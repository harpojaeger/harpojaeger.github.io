We waited after the show with a small group of other people for about half an hour to get David Byrne&#8217;s autograph. When he came out and started signing, we hung back a bit near the end of the line. I was expecting that after people got autographs they would leave, so he would see who was left, but everyone just kind of hung around. So before he got to us, he unceremoniously got on the bus and shut the door. I was astounded, and didn&#8217;t even think to say &#8220;Wait&#8221;. So we didn&#8217;t get autographs. Which was incredibly disappointing, because we could have had we spoken up or been more insistent. I was going to have him sign my shirt and my ticket stub. I would have worn the shirt tomorrow and gloated to every single person I saw that David Byrne signed my shirt. It would have been the best day ever.  
But no. All for naught.  
But it was still a fabulous show.
