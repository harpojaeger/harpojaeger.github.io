Not to be unoriginal or anything, but the college application process continues to take up a great deal of my brainpower. Between my constant homework-and-college-induced exhaustion and my actual schoolwork, I have been having a hard time functioning at school and at home. Fortunately, it will all be over this weekend.  
I have decided to apply early decision to Brown. This will also help lighten my load; everything will be done a lot sooner.
