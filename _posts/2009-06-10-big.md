I have upgraded this site and the <a href="http://carofawesomeness.com" target="_blank">LC(A) </a>to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2009/06/wordpress-28/" target="_blank">WordPress 2.8</a>.  2.8 doesn&#8217;t have as many new features as 2.7, but it&#8217;s a bunch faster, and I like it already.

I&#8217;ve made a monumental shift in my desktop computing setup.  For many many years, I have been using <a href="http://amarsagoo.info/namely/" target="_blank">Namely</a> as an application launcher.  I&#8217;ve tried <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html" target="_blank">LaunchBar</a> and <a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver" target="_blank">Quicksilver</a>, but neither was as fast or responsive as Namely.  I have now, for the first time, found a better application.  <a href="http://google.com/quicksearchbox" target="_blank">Google Quick Search Box for Mac</a> can launch applications with the speed of Namely (which the other two apps couldn&#8217;t), and it has more functionality as well (similar to the other apps).  It can search files on the computer, all sorts of application data, the internet (because it&#8217;s Google), and my Google account, including Gmail, Docs, Photos, Wikipedia, Google Finance, and more.  It&#8217;s incredibly useful.  It also has a somewhat under-documented and, as far as I can tell, under-utilized feature; Twitter updates.  This alone could persuade me to start Twittering, which I&#8217;ve been holding off on.  We&#8217;ll see.  Either way, QSB (for that is what they are calling it in the inter-tubes) is going to be great.
