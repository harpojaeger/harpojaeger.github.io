I was invited to open a free Google Voice account, and so far, it&#8217;s pretty cool.  I get an online inbox, free text messaging (although it may forward them to my phone, causing AT&T to charge me, I&#8217;m still figuring that out), and free calls anywhere in the US.  It can also transcribe my voicemails, screen my calls according to my contacts, and allow me to listen in on messages.  I also got a FABULOUS phone number.  I&#8217;m probably going to mess around with the settings a little more before I start giving out the number, but I think this could be pretty useful.  Probably its best feature is the ability to ring more than one phone.  If I have a dorm landline at college, I will definitely configure this; I can save some serious money and always be reachable on campus.  And I won&#8217;t have to give my number to anyone I don&#8217;t want to.  I can just block them or screen them if I want.
