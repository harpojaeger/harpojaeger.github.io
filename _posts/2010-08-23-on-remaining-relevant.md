Although I can&#8217;t blame my now-ending posting lapse on it, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot recently about how bloggers, or indeed any information synthesizers / analyzers remain relevant. Especially now that there are so many smart people writing about pretty much everything, it becomes difficult to actually say anything original. I don&#8217;t think this is a reason that one shouldn&#8217;t write (or speak, or whatever)  if you aren&#8217;t willing to try to contribute, you can&#8217;t develop your opinion, and even if you are repetitive at times, it&#8217;s worth it in the long run. But it is a consideration.

It doesn&#8217;t seem that there&#8217;s a single ingredient that makes for always-relevant material. Focusing solely on national or global issues certainly puts you in a pretty big pond, but getting too local makes you irrelevant to anyone outside where you live, or worse, anyone who lives *differently* than you do, even in the same location. So while I intend to start focusing on local issues more frequently, I&#8217;m not planning to give up analysis of larger affairs, particularly because I think there&#8217;s a dearth of attention being paid to some of them (<a href="http://www.google.com/news/search?aq=f&pz=1&cf=all&ned=us&hl=en&q=flooding+in+pakistan" target="_blank">climate change comes to mind</a>).

Some upcoming blog-projects: a series on drug policy, maybe a review of <a href="http://northamptonmedia.com/?p=5558" target="_blank">the upcoming Northampton Coke plant expansion</a> (&#8220;Lane wrote that without a local property tax break, freedom from having to pay for infrastructure upgrades, state tax credits and job training funds, Cokes investment here was no sure thing.&#8221;), and some stuff on the Northwestern DA election and the pros/cons of statutory rape prosecutions. Also working on a new title for the site (yes, &#8220;working on.&#8221; It&#8217;s a big decision!)
