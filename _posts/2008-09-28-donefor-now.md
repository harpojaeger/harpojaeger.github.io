I have finished work for the weekend. I wrote the final draft of my main essay, completed the main section of the Common App, completed the supplements, wrote first drafts of the shorter essays for the supplements, and started the Columbia application, as they&#8217;re not on the Common App. I still need to do the Olin application. I am going to take a shower, eat, and head downtown for a few hours. I will be doing more work this week, and possibly some next weekend as well.
