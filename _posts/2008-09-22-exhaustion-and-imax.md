I had a long and arduous day, due in part to the fact that my pertussis is now compounded by terrible nasal congestion. I was glad to be home and back at school, and all of my friends were excited to hear my tales of The Dark Knight in IMAX. I did some research and found some rather fascinating info about IMAX projection. Apparently the projection units can <s>way</s> weigh almost two tons, and have a complicated compound lens system designed to be easily cleanable *during* projection. This is because if a little bit of gunk gets on the lens from the film, it will take up the entire screen because the magnification is so huge. The bulbs used in the projectors consume 15 kilowatts of power, and contain xenon at a pressure of 26 atmospheres. This is so high that when operators are servicing the machines they must wear protective body armor because if the bulb were to explode they could be seriously injured or killed.  
Combining the most hardcore and awesome movie of recent memory with the most hardcore and awesome technical projection methods, you get the ultimate hardcore and awesome cinematic experience. And we had Milk Duds. Truly, life is good.
