  Straight up.  U.S. out of Afghanistan.
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 10px; padding: 0px;">
  I&#8217;m beginning like this because it&#8217;s a change of heart.  I&#8217;ve never been supportive of a full withdrawal from Afghanistan until now.  I&#8217;ve believed that there are definite military actions we could take to defeat the Taliban and prevent the drug trafficking economy from supporting them and Al Qaeda.  And I still believe this is true.  But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth it any more.

  Which is more of a threat to our national security right now, the Taliban, or global climate change?  Which is killing more citizens, extremists or health insurance recision?

  There may be a place for U.S. military engagement in Afghanistan in the future.  But given the amount of resources and political energy we&#8217;re putting into it right now, it&#8217;s not worth it.  Perhaps with a meaningful international effort, one that gathers world leaders together to discuss not the current strategy but the current problem.  Because there is definitely a problem.  But what we&#8217;ve been lacking this far is an even-handed evaluation of how to best approach that problem.  From the beginning, it was the Bush administration botching what could have been an effective campaign by diverting attention to Iraq, turning our allies against us by committing human rights abuses, and now it&#8217;s generals holding press conferences rather than using the military chain of command.  Our strategy in the Middle East has from the beginning been based around self-interest, and that&#8217;s holding with us today.

  We need to step back, and confront the problem from an outsider&#8217;s stance.  I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any other way to really do this well.

  Hilary Clinton said something during the 2008 Democratic primaries that I thought was very insightful.  When asked about the apparent success of the Bush troop surge in Iraq as compared to her proposed strategy, she pointed out that there are different ways to define victory.  She said that yes, it&#8217;s true that putting more troops somewhere gives you a <em>tactical</em> advantage.  But were we then any closer to being out of Iraq than we were before the surge?  And the answer was no.
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 10px; padding: 0px;">
  We may be now, but what was the cost?  Too high.  We can&#8217;t repeat that.
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 10px; padding: 0px;">
  Obama, let&#8217;s end this before it starts.  Afghanistan will be another Iraq, it will be another Vietnam, it will be another distraction from the countless issues facing this country that affect far more people ad are farm more solvable.  As Jon Stewart says, it&#8217;s chow time.
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 10px; padding: 0px;">
  Civilian control of the military is important.  Go back to the definition of victory.  Realize that we&#8217;re dealing with generals here.  Their job is to win wars.  To have a <em>tactical</em> advantage.  We don&#8217;t need a tactical advantage now.  We need our money, our troops, and our time back.

  Bring them home now.
