Our plans changed rather suddenly this evening.  We were not able to go to the rabbi&#8217;s house for dinner, so I instead went to our synagogue&#8217;s community Seder.  And this was no ordinary seder.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deval_Patrick" target="_blank">Deval Patrick</a> himself, the governor of Massachusetts, arrived, and ate with us.  I managed to corner him before he left, and talked to him about charter schools.  I had heard that he opposed them (which I doubted, as it is an oversimplification), and he vigorously denied it as I had thought he would.  He did make the very interesting point that what Massachusetts has not done such a good job of is using charter schools as &#8220;laboratories&#8221;, as he put it, and applying what we learn from these schools to the district system.  Building off of this, I would say that the reason people are often angry about charter schools is because they don&#8217;t see any benefit to having them.  If we look at charter schools as a government investment that allows a new perspective on public education, we see an immediate benefit, as long as those perspectives are used constructively.  I don&#8217;t know what specific legal steps Patrick plans to take to make this more of a reality, but I appreciate the clarity of his goals, and his willingness to communicate them.

I got a photo with him, but I was using my mom&#8217;s celphone camera, and did not save it properly, so it is gone forever.  So it goes.
