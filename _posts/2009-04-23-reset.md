I am working on a pretty excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell" target="_blank">shell script</a> that resets a Mac OS X computer back to factory defaults.  This is useful for when I do a clean install at work and then need to install after-market software.  I create an initial user account, install the software, and then run the script to remove the user, leaving the installed software in place and ready to use when a new account is created.  As it is right now, the script does what it&#8217;s supposed to do.  I think I will give it a few more features and make it a little prettier, and then put up a link to it here, as it could be pretty useful.

We have an ultimate tournament on Saturday at <a href="http://nmhschool.org" target="_blank">NMH</a>.  We are in the A division, which is cool because it will be really competitive and awesome, but not cool because a lot of our newer players will not get much playing time.  That is a bummer.  I went to the <a href="http://hrymca.org" target="_blank">Y</a> tonight and am going again tomorrow, so I will be in excellent shape on Saturday.  I think it is important that I have been exercising regularly when the tournament comes around, so it is not a shock to my muscles to suddenly be doing work.  I had an awesome workout tonight and am looking forward to another tomorrow.  And now, sleep beckons.
