&#8230;is on Thursday. I think this means I will receive the letter Saturday. It will be crazy. I am getting home from work and immediately leaving for two shows right in a row. My friend who also applied ED to Brown is in the shows, so I think I may get the letter when I come home, and bring it with me without opening it, so we can open our letters together. Maybe not though; there is great potential for hurt feelings in this case. Although that is probably true no matter what we do.  
We will see.
