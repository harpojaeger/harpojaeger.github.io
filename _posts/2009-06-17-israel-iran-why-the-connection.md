We continually here that Iran is the biggest threat to Israel&#8217;s national security.  Whenever we talk about Iran in the U.S., or whenever U.S. diplomats talk with Iran, Israel is always on the table?  Why?  Well, we&#8217;re told it&#8217;s because Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is a Holocaust denier (which he is), that a &#8220;nuclear Iran&#8221; would result in Israel&#8217;s annihilation (which it well might), etc.  Here&#8217;s the problem: we&#8217;re ignoring what it is that keeps Iran in this position.  Ahmadinejad is indeed a crazy dude, in my opinion unfit to lead a country, and has demonstrated his disrespect for the Iranian people in this last election.  But there&#8217;s a larger pattern: crazy dictators have been fine with us for a long time.  Israel&#8217;s hardline foreign policy stance and refusal to engage in meaningful diplomacy when it needs to has historically driven people away from it.  Netanyahu&#8217;s denial of Arab&#8217;s right of return, and ignoring of their connection to the land, is, frankly, biblical and archaic.  I&#8217;ve said this before, but I still think the issue is at the core of Israel&#8217;s identity; as a religious state, Israel is in a position to claim divine right to the land.  No wonder people like Ahmadinejad adopt a polarizing stance against Israel.  Israel maintains that it is the most legitimate entity in that region.  That&#8217;s no way to approach peace, or even dialogue about peace.  That&#8217;s something that Israel needs to stop if it wants to call for negotiations &#8220;without preconditions&#8221;.

Netanyahu&#8217;s speech shows that he&#8217;s capable of more of the same.  Obama&#8217;s pressure on him is having an effect; Netanyah actually said the phrase &#8220;Palestinian state&#8221;.  But there&#8217;s a long way to go.  As citizens of the U.S., we need to demand that the Obama administration continue direct and tough diplomacy with Israel.
