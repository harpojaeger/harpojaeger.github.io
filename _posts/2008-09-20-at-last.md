We are about to arrive at Penn Station, where I will take the subway to the apartment I&#8217;m staying at. My father has told me I should stop at the Jersey Transit waiting room to look at the sculpture there, as it as made by a former metalworking teacher of his from MassArt, so I will do that before leaving. I am very excited for this weekend, and ready to be off the train and in the city, although I do like the subway very much. I suppose that is one thing I am looking forward to this weekend; taking the subway. Not something I can do at home.
