<a href="http://www.thenation.com/directory/bios/jessica_arons" target="_blank">Jessica Arons</a> has written a <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20100315/arons" target="_blank">fabulous piece</a> for <a href="http://www.thenation.com/" target="_blank">The Nation</a>, explaining just how moronic the thinking behind the Stupak amendment is (and thus reminding me of how glad I am it won&#8217;t be part of the final reform bill):

> No transaction in our modern society is completely free of government involvement. The food we eat costs less because of farm subsidies. Students attend private universities with the help of Pell Grants and Stafford loans. Our churches and temples can afford to operate in part because they are tax-exempt. And employers who offer health insurance do so because of tax incentives. Stupak&#8217;s reasoning, taken to its logical extreme, would mean that virtually every activity in which we engage is government funded, regardless of whether it is condoned or condemned.

As I see it, the extension of her argument is that in supporting, for example, transportation subsidies, a person makes a judgment that the good derived from the availability of public transportation outweighs the harm done by freeing up citizens&#8217; personal money to be used for an abortion.  Thus, opposing insurance premium subsidies is a judgment that the benefits of providing people with health insurance are less important than preventing those people from having abortions.

Simultaneously opposing insurance premium subsidies on abortion grounds while also supporting other federal subsidies shows that you prioritize your own religious or social beliefs over someone else&#8217;s health.  While this isn&#8217;t a logical inconsistency, I&#8217;d say it demonstrates a severe lack of empathy and a healthy dose of self-righteousness.

But then, those are all in a day&#8217;s work for congressional opponents of health care reform.
