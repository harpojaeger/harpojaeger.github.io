I made steak tonight for the first time ever. I have eaten many times before, but never made it. It turned out rather well. I made a dinner of roasted russet and sweet potatoes, and sauteÃ©d the steak with onions. My father assembled a salad at the last minute, as I realized I had neglected to do so.
