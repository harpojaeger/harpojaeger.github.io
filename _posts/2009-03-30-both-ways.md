I have just discovered that if I edit my subscribed Google calendars in iCal, they sync to the server.  This is awesome.  The only issue is that iCal has to be open to sync stuff.  So I can no longer just use my really awesome natural-language event-creating dashboard widget <a href="http://smellypuppy.com/wp/?page_id=29" target="_blank">QuickCal</a> on its own.  I have to open iCal first.  This is not really that big of a deal.  In fact, putting things in perspective, it&#8217;s pretty cool that I can receive an email, press a button, type in &#8220;Meeting tomorrow from noon until 12:30 pm&#8221;, press enter, and have it appear in my Google calendar.  All that QuickCal lacks is location support, but I am sure this will be implemented soon.  Perhaps it will support attendees and invitations as well for the ultimate Google integration experience.
