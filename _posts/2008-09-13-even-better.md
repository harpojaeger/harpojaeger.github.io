Tonight&#8217;s show was even better than last night&#8217;s.  In terms of tech, when you have this many variables in a single show (4 TVs, lights, sound, etc.), you can&#8217;t expect everything to go exactly as planned.  So when someone says &#8220;Did it work?&#8221;, I have to think about what that actually means.  I don&#8217;t think it would be possible to have a show where everything worked precisely the way it was supposed to.  But tonight&#8217;s show *was* flawless, because the tech did exactly what it was supposed to.  It didn&#8217;t get in the way, there weren&#8217;t any huge or noticeable errors, and it added a lot to the show.  So yes, I think it went perfectly.  And I am very proud.
