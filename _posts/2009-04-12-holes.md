I dug three holes, each three feet wide, and one-and-a-half feet deep.  Two and half hours of work for a total of thirty dollars gives me twelve dollars an hour (not bad).  But I wanted to calculate how much I was paid per volume of dirt (disregarding the rather substantial rocks I had to dig out and move).

So:

> Three holes, with a radius of one-and-a-half feet, and a depth of three feet.
> 
> πr<sup>2</sup>h = π(1.5)<sup>2</sup>1.5
> 
> 3π/2 ft.<sup>3</sup> dirt per hole.
> 
> Thirty dollars for three holes is ten dollars per hole.
> 
> 10/(3π/2)=20/(3π) $/ft.<sup>3</sup> dirt ≅ 2.122065907891938 $/ft.<sup>3</sup> dirt.

I bought David Byrne&#8217;s new album, <a href="http://everythingthathappens.com" target="_blank">Everything That Happens Will Happen Today</a> online.  So far, it is pretty awesome.  I wish I had noticed the option to buy it in <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">FLAC</a> as well as MP3, seemingly for no extra charge, but I didn&#8217;t.  Oh well.  I did buy the vinyl package, so in a few days I will receive the album on vinyl, which is going to be great.
