This week was pretty tiring. I watched the last Presidential debate on Wednesday night and went out swing dancing on Thursday night, which was excellent. I had originally planned to leave for my visit to Brown in Rhode Island this morning, but I put that off until tomorrow. I will be going for the day to the engineering open house.  
Today we did not have open mic during the normally scheduled time, from 2:00 to 3:00 at the end of the day, so we had recess instead. For the last hour of school, everyone was outside playing foursquare (which me and a few other people have made extremely popular recently) or just hanging out. There were also footie pajamas involved.  
I have been working on a version of the literary game Exquisite Corpse for this site for the past few weeks. I think it will be ready to go live tonight or sometime in the next few days. I am very excited to see how it works once I have it running.
