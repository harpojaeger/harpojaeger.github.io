<a href="http://jewschool.com/2010/05/04/22580/in-which-richard-silverstein-misses-the-point/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve differed with Richard Silverstein before</a>, and I find myself doing so again today.  I joined an FB group he created, but upon further thought, I&#8217;ve decided to leave it.  This is due to a very specific grievance; the second item on the group&#8217;s manifesto reads &#8220;2. that the U.S. government condemn unequivocally the attack on a Turkish ship in international waters; and join other EU countries in withdrawing our ambassador.&#8221;

I&#8217;ve got no problem with the U.S. unequivocally condemning the attack.  While I blame the activists for not remaining nonviolent (which <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYjkLUcbJWo&feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">they clearly didn&#8217;t</a>) from both a moral and tactical perspective (if they had stayed peaceful, this could have been an incredible way to draw attention to the cruelty of the blockade), that doesn&#8217;t excuse Israel&#8217;s actions in the first place.  All parties involved in yesterday&#8217;s events made clear that they have no interest in a peaceful resolution to the conflict.  It&#8217;s going to take a lot of work to get them there.

And this is something we already know.  Which is why I can&#8217;t support any kind of intentional deterioration in diplomatic relations right now.  Crises like this one make the moral and practical imperative for productive dialogue even more pressing.  I object to the group&#8217;s belief that we should withdraw our ambassador.

I urge Richard to remove the second part of second item of the group&#8217;s beliefs.  Only then will I feel comfortable rejoining, because only then will the group truly be advocating for peace.
