I got another email back from NASA in response to my second letter.

> Dear Harpo:
> 
> Thank you for your inquiry to NASA of September 15, 2008.
> 
> Under Federal regulation, NASA is authorized to accept technical proposals for evaluation only under one of two conditions: a proposal must either be (1) submitted in response to a formal competitive solicitation; or (2) presented as an unsolicited proposal. The procedure for submitting an unsolicited proposal is described in a NASA guidebook located at http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/hq/library/unSol-Prop.html. The concept you describe is not structured as an unsolicited proposal as defined by the guidebook. Therefore, as submitted, it cannot be accepted for review. These rules are primarily intended to protect patent rights and copyright privileges of inventors.
> 
> Also, included in the above Web site are the respective NASA Centers and their particular technical areas of responsibility under the section entitled, “NASA Research areas and addresses for submission.” Perhaps you can address your questions directly to the respective NASA Center for an expedited response. After you review that information, should you continue to believe that your proposal would be more appropriately aligned with an area of research associated with a particular NASA Center, please forward a valid unsolicited proposal directly to that Center. You are strongly encouraged to follow the instructions as outlined in the “Guidance for the Preparations and Submission of Unsolicited Proposals,” Web site so that NASA Center personnel can process and fairly review your proposal.
> 
> NASA hopes that this information will be helpful to you as you pursue your goals.  
> Your interest in NASA and America’s space program is appreciated.
> 
> Sincerely,
>

I followed the link, and the page contains a lot of dense legal terminology and concepts, so it will take me a little while to parse it all and get this moving. I do intend to follow through and submit the theory. Further updates as I progress.
