I&#8217;m at our friends&#8217; annual Labor Day Party, an all-evening affair. The music has begun; it&#8217;s mostly blues at this point. As the evening progresses, the musicians tend to shuffle around a fair amount, so I&#8217;m sure before too long, we&#8217;ll be hitting the requisite rock and funk, especially once the sax player takes the stage. It promises to be an excellent night of music.
