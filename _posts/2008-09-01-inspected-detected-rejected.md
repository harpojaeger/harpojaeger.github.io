I have been giving a prescription for azithromycin, which is used to treat whooping cough, among other things. It seems that at some point my vaccinations for whooping cough were not up to date, and this may have something to do with it. They are also giving me a spacer for the inhaler, which I am to continue using. It looks as though I may be out of here relatively soon.
