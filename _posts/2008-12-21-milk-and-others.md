Milk was WONDERFUL. I think I will go see it again after New Year&#8217;s with a friend who couldn&#8217;t come with us on Friday. I also might go on the 30th or 31st with my friends who are going to be here from out of town.  
I had an interesting day at work yesterday. I though I had heard every strange sound that computers make when they are broken, but I was proved wrong. A gentleman brought in an iBook that, when turned on, made an shrieking noise like a soul in torment. Although I can&#8217;t be sure without a diagnostic, it sounded to me like the hard drive; it was coming from that area, and I think it could have been the read/write head physically dragging on the surface of the spinning disk. It was incredibly loud and sounded as if the computer was crying out in pain.  
I think I will not be able to go into work today, as I have a lot of homework to finish, and an igloo to build. If the construction goes well, I may sleep in it tonight with my youngest sister, who started building it yesterday.
