We&#8217;ve had no Internet access all day at my house. Verizon terminated our DSL for some reason. Hopefully I will be able to convince them to turn it back on tomorrow morning. Fortunately, I have WordPress for the iPhone, and a cellular data connection, so I&#8217;m still connected to the tubes.
