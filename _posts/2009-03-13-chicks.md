Our new baby chicks arrived at the post office this morning. There are about twenty. We only ordered nine hens, but they have a certain amount they have to send in each box to keep them warm, so they just give you extra roosters, because no one wants roosters. So once they get old enough to crow we will get rid of them, but for now they are pretty cute.

Also, we have eggs arriving pretty soon that we will be hatching. We opted not to use an incubator and just to let some of the more broody hens sit on the eggs, which will be pretty awesome.

I picked up two more books for the honors project that I am doing with a friend for Rise and Fall of the Great Powers. The project is on eighteenth-century European finance and economic policy, and these two books look pretty interesting. Apparently there was something called the Dutch Tulip Mania, and there was an economic group called the Loco-Focos. Both sound pretty weird. The Dutch Tulip Mania involved bulb futures, a rather odd concept, and the Loco-Focos appear to be some kind of group that advocated a no-paper-money policy. We will see.

Our opponent for our next trial has been revealed: Massachusetts Academy of Mathematics and Science from Worcester, who beat Lowell Catholic High School. We will face them in Springfield on Monday.
