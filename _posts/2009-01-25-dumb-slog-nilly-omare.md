&#8230;is a fabulous movie. After our Mock Trial meeting today, I went to see it with two other friends.

It has been a busy day. I didn&#8217;t go in to work, so Will and I worked on the <a href="http://www.carofawesomeness.com" target="_blank">LC(A) website</a> until about two forty-five. The meeting was very productive, but tiring, and I was glad to get to let of some steam. The movie was not terribly relaxing, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The main character&#8217;s brother Salim looked strikingly like Michael Jackson.

I am now officially a denizen of the Intertubes. I have a Twitter. I&#8217;m only using it to track my blog posts; whenever I post, a new Twitter with a link to the post is automatically created. Still, though, I feel as though I have sacrificed a little bit of my Internet individuality. On the other hand, Twitter is a widely used tool, and if it can help me get my content out to a wider audience, it is rational for me to use it. We shall see.
