I came back from the NHC Summer Institute with a rather terrible cough, which has persisted and worsened significantly. I was prescribed an inhaler on the premise that it was some kind of allergy-induced asthma, but it didn&#8217;t help that much. Now am I am in the ER, since it&#8217;s Labor Day and the doctor&#8217;s office is closed. The doctor on call recommended that I come in to get x-rays and the like, so here I am. It looks like I may be here for a while.
