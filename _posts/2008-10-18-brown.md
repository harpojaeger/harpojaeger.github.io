I have just gotten out of the info session, and we&#8217;re heading into downtown Providence for lunch. We left the tour partway through and got some food before going to the info session, which was very large (~100-200 people). I am excited for the engineerig open house this afternoon, but for the moment I am ready to find some food and relax.
