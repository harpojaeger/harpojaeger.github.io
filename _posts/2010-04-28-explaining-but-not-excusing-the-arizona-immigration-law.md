Eugene Robinson has what I think is so far t<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/26/AR2010042602595.html" target="_blank">he best analysis of the new immigration law in Arizona</a>:

> Arizona&#8217;s draconian new immigration law is an abomination &#8212; racist, arbitrary, oppressive, mean-spirited, unjust.

I&#8217;d recommend reading the whole thing; he goes into some pretty specific detail, and also mentions something that&#8217;s otherwise absent from the debate.

> Let me interrupt this tirade to point out that while Arizona has unquestionably done the wrong thing, it is understandable that exasperated officials believed they had to do*something*. Immigration policy and border security are federal responsibilities, and Washington has failed miserably to address what Arizonans legitimately see as a crisis.

It&#8217;s a good point.  Looking at this as a deliberate attack on illegal immigrants (and a deliberate attempt at racial profiling) would be misleading.  I don&#8217;t think the people who passed this law actually favor legalized discrimination against Latinos, at least not consciously.  But the law&#8217;s passage reveals something about ethnocentricity and Americanism – that we still see whiteness as the &#8220;default&#8221; in this country.  Somehow, the existence of other races and cultures is a threat to &#8220;American-ness&#8221;.  Clearly this is a load of junk; this country was built on immigrants and continues to thrive off of their cheap labor.  In the present day, <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/01/raising_the_floor.html" target="_blank">easier paths to legalization would lead to significant economic benefits.</a>

Opposition to flexible and fair immigration policies is in my experience associated with an extreme form of nativist patriotism; the idea that America is intrinsically better than other countries.  I&#8217;m the first person to defend the Constitution as one of the finest documents on which to establish a government, and I think there are in fact intrinsic advantages to the American judicial and legal systems.  But that&#8217;s not the same as saying that this country is better by virtue of its existence, or is fated to be that way.  We got a lot of stuff right that a lot of other countries didn&#8217;t.  We also got a lot of stuff wrong.  And like every country, we should be trying to fix the things that are wrong, and we should be helping others do the same.  In a way, this means that I see America&#8217;s &#8220;greatness&#8221; not as a gift, but as a privilege that implies many important responsibilities.

So here&#8217;s where I get confused: if the type of uber-patriots I&#8217;m talking about really think America&#8217;s so great, they should have no problem with allowing others access to it.  If this is really the greatest country in the world, how can a bunch of poor people who want a better life be that much of a threat?  The answer is that American nativists believe that they&#8217;re special by virtue of having been born here, and immigrants are somehow &#8220;less American&#8221;.  Obviously illegal immigrants aren&#8217;t citizens, but don&#8217;t forget that what makes this country fundamentally different from the world of nation-states from which it arose is that the only thing required to be part of it was to *want* to.  In practice, there were and are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">fair</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_crow" target="_blank"> amount</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DADT" target="_blank">obstacles</a> to this rather lofty dream, but it&#8217;s undeniable that we have gotten and continue to get closer and closer to it.

For modern-day nativists to claim that American-ness should be restricted to those of us who are already here is totally contrary to the principle of equal access and to the historical trend towards this principle.  It&#8217;s a disguised form of racism, a historical tendency to view whiteness, and only whiteness, as &#8220;true American-ness&#8221;.  While the definition of who is and is not white has changed over time (historically excluding, to name a few, Catholics, Irish, and Jews, all of whom are considered &#8220;white&#8221; today), it&#8217;s sure that Latino immigrants aren&#8217;t included in it now.  Comprehensive federal immigration reform would be a good opportunity to affirm that whiteness is no longer required to receive the full benefits of citizenship.  Obviously it won&#8217;t fix racial inequalities in and of itself, but a progressive immigration policy would do a lot to put us on the right track.
