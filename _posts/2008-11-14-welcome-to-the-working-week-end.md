Here ends one of my more exhausting weeks. Between the general pressure of school work and my long night (morning) yesterday (today), I am very ready for this week to be over. I will sleep well tonight.  
Tomorrow I am going to work before meeting Will and going to my school&#8217;s production of King Lear. We will work tomorrow night and Sunday morning. I will be going to work again on Sunday, and that evening I have a rehearsal and then a show.  
I need to find some time to do homework somewhere in there. I&#8217;m not sure how I will do this, but somehow I don&#8217;t feel that stressed about it.  
Let the relaxation begin.
