Okay, it turns out that the Google Calendar gadget on iGoogle has natural-language input support too!  Also, it can do locations.  This is just ridiculous.  Everything is going to work so much better than it would have before.

It is a good thing that Google is not evil, because if they were they would control the world.

My new motto for all things technological: 

> If there is a product, service, or technology, Google makes a version that is better than the one you have, and it is free.
