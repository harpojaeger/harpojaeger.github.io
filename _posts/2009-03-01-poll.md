I am trying out a poll plugin for WordPress.  If it works, I may start having a Poll of the Week or something like that.  The current one (tonic water) comes from a discussion I had at school about how AWESOME tonic water is.  My classmates were not so refined as I on this matter.  I had a FABULOUS day on Friday because I began it by drinking a glass of tonic water, but my peers remain unconvinced.

Vote, vote, vote.  Unless you are a felon.  &#8216;Cause felons can&#8217;t vote.
