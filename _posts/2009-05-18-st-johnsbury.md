I got back late last night (around ten-thirty) from the St. Johnsbury tournament.  It was awesome.  We started in the B division, and since we won all four of our games on Saturday, we moved into the A division.  We lost to Four Rivers Sunday morning, but then won our final two games, putting us in fifth place in the A division, which is pretty impressive.  I am exhausted and sick, but it was a great experience.  I&#8217;m home from school today recuperating, and tomorrow we have two away games, one after the other, at Four Rivers, and then we are having a big party, which I think will be a lot of fun.  Four Rivers, and the other school we&#8217;re playing, Compass, are both really fun teams to play, and just nice people in general.

The members of the Mock Trial team who are on the competing team for the <a href="http://www.njsbf.org/educators-and-students/programs/hs-american-mocktrial.html" target="_blank">AMTI</a> (not me) are in New Jersey right now.  I don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;re doing, but I&#8217;m hoping to here from them soon.  They&#8217;ll be back very early in the morning tomorrow, and I will see them on Wednesday or Thursday at school.  We have no school on Friday, and that night is the prom.  I will be wearing tails.
