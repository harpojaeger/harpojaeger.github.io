Frankly, I can&#8217;t claim to be shocked about the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/01/live_coverage_o.html" target="_blank">outcome of the special election here in MA</a>.  I&#8217;m appalled, but not terribly surprised.  From all evidence, Coakley ran a bad campaign and Brown ran a good one.  Even a solidly-Democratic state like this one can&#8217;t withstand that sort of treatment, and Brown was enough of a catch-all for people&#8217;s non-specific anger towards vague concepts like big government that he harnessed anger from both sides of the aisle.  Democrats should have seen this coming.

More importantly, however, I don&#8217;t really care about Scott Brown.  Yes, he has a truck.  Yes, he doesn&#8217;t really seem to have any sort of useful policy ideas.  In other words, he&#8217;s not really that different than any other sitting GOP Senator.

I guess what makes it different (theoretically) is the fact that we no longer have our magical awesome super-great-majority.  But let&#8217;s face it, we couldn&#8217;t even get anything close to meaningful reform even with one.  This won&#8217;t be that different

If we want to avoid a filibuster, we can try to get the House to vote on the existing Senate health care bill.  The House Progressive Caucus is strong enough, however, that I doubt that would go through without a fuss, and right now, we need to just get it done so we can move on and have something to campaign on in 2010.

But after much thought, I&#8217;m not sure we want to avoid a filibuster.  Just the threat of one so far has been enough to swing the Senate negotiations dramatically in favor of the GOP.  What if we, as Obama <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/promise/517/health-care-reform-public-sessions-C-SPAN/" target="_blank">promised</a> during his campaign, televised every bit of what was going on on the Senate floor, and in fact *forced* the GOP to filibuster?  They could no longer claim that we were shoving it down America&#8217;s throat.  We&#8217;d stand up and say &#8220;Look, you&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s denying a straight vote and a real debate.  You want to have &#8216;em, let&#8217;s go, and then we&#8217;ll vote.  If not, we&#8217;ll show every single person in America exactly where your interest lies.&#8221;

We&#8217;ve been playing games to try to avoid a filibuster up until now.  We can&#8217;t avoid it any more unless we want to woo a Republican over, which is completely implausible.  For crying out loud, they&#8217;re already promising to repeal the thing when they take power.

Now that we can&#8217;t avoid it any more, it&#8217;s time to look a GOP filibuster square in the eye.  Give us your best shot.

I&#8217;m waiting and ready.  America&#8217;s watching.
