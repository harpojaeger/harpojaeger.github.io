I have just taken the SAT Reasoning Test. It was not as difficult as it was the first time, and I think I did better, although I clearly can&#8217;t know until I get my scores back in a few weeks. I&#8217;m not allowed to talk about the content of the test, but I will say that one of the reading passages reminded of a Simon and Garfunkel song.
