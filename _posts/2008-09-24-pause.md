I&#8217;d like to take a moment of silence for the eleven victims of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauhajoki_school_shooting" target="_blank">Kauhajoki school shooting</a> in Finland, including the gunman himself. He deserves our pity as much as our anger.  
We should learn from this, as we should have learned from every other shooting and act of violent crime that came before. How many more innocents must become accidental and tragic martyrs for some unknown cause? Let there be an end to this. Let it be soon.
