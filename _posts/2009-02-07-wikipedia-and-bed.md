Browsing the Wikipedia page for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev" target="_blank">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, I found myself on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plywood" target="_blank">Plywood</a> page within five minutes.  There are apparently only three degrees of separation between the two.  Who knew?

Bed is an immediate destination.
