I arrived at Chemistry class last week all prepared (or so I thought) with a three-ring binder, looseleaf college-ruled paper (which turns out to be my teacher&#8217;s favorite kind), pencils, pens, a graphing calculator, etc. Turns out that we are required to have a marble composition notebook for our lab notes. This is because a real lab notebook would have unremovale pages, so a scientist could not &#8220;cheat&#8221; and take out pages for whatever reason. I have reluctantly, therefore, just finished another school supply trip, this one to the local overstock outlet. Better than Target and Wal-Mart, but still a drag.  
On the bright side, I am looking forward to this class. I think it will be a lot of fun. We may even get to blow things up.
