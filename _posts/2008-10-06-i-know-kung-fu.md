The Kung-fu class went very well. I led the first one, a one-on-one with a more advanced third-degree white belt student who also runs WPI&#8217;s unoffical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour" target="_blank">parkour</a> mailing list. My friend led the second class and I participated, working with two of the beginners as he worked with the other one. This class was severly disrupted by cheerleading practice taking place in the adjacent gym, which is aurally inseparable from the martial arts room due to a low dividing wall and high ceiling. It is very difficult to meditate through cries of &#8220;T-O-U-C-H-D-O-W-N&#8221;.  
After class we returned to the apartment. My friend appears to subsist entirely on a diet of noodles with Parmesan cheese, so I prepared myself a sauce of tomatoes, green peppers, mushrooms, and various spices to accompany my spaghetti.  
I am planning to shower and head to bed. I will wake up around 9:00 tomorrow mornig to attend the 10:00 information session. I will then return to the apartment and leave in the late morning or early afternoon.
