I spent the better part of the day at work moving things around.  We are in the middle of a giant reorganization of  the Service Department, and there is much to be done.  We deconstructed and moved tables, lugged around heavy old computer equipment, organized hundreds of component screws, and more.  Okay, maybe screw organization isn&#8217;t terribly physically taxing, but it was a long day.
