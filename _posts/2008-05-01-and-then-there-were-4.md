I&#8217;ve been idolizing Eddie Izzard and dreaming of seeing him for about five years. Considering how much I&#8217;d built up my expectations for the show last night, it would have been difficult for me to enjoy it. That being said, my expectations were wholly exceeded. Eddie Izzard is, and was last night, the funniest human being alive, as I said in my last post. Anyone who has a chance should see this latest &#8220;Stripped&#8221; tour. There are just enough references to other jokes to make it funny and engaging, but not so many that it seems like he&#8217;s recycling material. Overall, he was amazing.  
The four best shows I&#8217;ve seen, in no particular order, are:  
&bull;Eddie Izzard  
&bull;James Brown  
&bull;They Might Be Giants  
&bull;Toots and the Maytals
