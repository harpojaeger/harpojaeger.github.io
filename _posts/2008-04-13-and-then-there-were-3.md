Toots and the Maytals has taken its rightful place among the best shows I&#8217;ve ever seen. There are now three, the other two being James Brown and They Might Be Giants. And the openers &#8211; Fear Nuttin&#8217; Band &#8211; were amazing! They have an album coming out sometime soon I think, and I encourage all of you to buy it. Sort of a blend of hardcore, reggae, and rap; incredibly tight and very loud. Toots and the Maytals were somewhat more relaxed, as was the audience (which might have had something to do with how much more of the audience was high once Toots came on). Regardless, the show was incredible, and I didn&#8217;t get out until after midnight. A most enjoyable evening all around, and extremely memorable.
