I have made a lot of progress, with a first draft of pretty much all of my essays and questions, and a final draft of most. I still need to assemble some supplementary materials, like demonstrations of my music, and a copy of an article about the Mock Trial team last year. I&#8217;m taking a break for a little while to eat, relax, and otherwise distance myself from the application process.
