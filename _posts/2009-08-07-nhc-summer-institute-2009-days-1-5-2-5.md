<a href="http://www2.massbar.org/pub_programs/mock_trial/photo.php?a_id=51&c_id=&pg=10" target="_blank">I argue a lot</a>. People who have met me tend to realize this pretty quickly. So I was pretty excited to go to last night&#8217;s dialogue on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. After getting there, though, I had some serious reservations. The session was structured in order to deliberately avoid direct arguing! What would I do? I often feel lost in discussions where there&#8217;s no opportunity to challenge people.

But it quickly became clear that the model for this session was very well-planned. Designed and facilitated by the <a href="http://www.jewishdialogue.org/" target="_blank">Jewish Dialogue Group</a>, it allowed for participants to state their background and feelings on the issues, and then to engage in what was called a &#8220;connected conversation&#8221;, where we could respond to each other, but within the constraints of statements about ourselves. We could talk about how we felt about another person&#8217;s opinion, but we can&#8217;t directly challenge them or ask them for a response, except for clarifying questions. What this leads to is an absence of what on the surface appears to be the only type of probing discussion. However, participating in the discussion, I learned a lot about other points of view, and about the objective facts at issue. The session didn&#8217;t, as I had anticipated it might, descend into a bunch of people talking about how they felt with no material evidence in question. Rather, we discussed concrete and applicable concepts.

After the discussion, I spoke with the organizer, and indicated on the email list that I was interested in taking the facilitator training in order to facilitate (obviously) this kind of dialogue elsewhere. I don&#8217;t know what the status of Brown&#8217;s dialogue on these issues is, but I&#8217;m excited to get involved as a participant and potentially a facilitator.

I wrapped up both of my classes today. In the morning, we baked all of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challah" target="_blank">challah</a> for the <a href="http://havurah.org/institute" target="_blank">Institute</a>, and in the afternoon, we finished up by talking about the financial aspect of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shemitah" target="_blank">Shemitah</a>, whereby debts between individuals are forgiven at the end of the Shemitah year. We looked at a recent opinion piece comparing a rabbinical exception to this procedure to Secretary Paulson&#8217;s bailout in late 2008.

I&#8217;m about to write my first post for <a href="http:/jewschool.com" target="_blank">Jewschool</a>! If I&#8217;ve set everything up correctly, it should show up here as well.
