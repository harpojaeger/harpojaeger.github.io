My backpack got a lot heavier today. It looks as though I may be doing an independent study of Calculus 4, so I&#8217;m now carrying around the Anton Calculus book, which is almost 1500 pages long. I haven&#8217;t even received my Chemistry or Statistics books yet.  
My academic load this year looks to be quite heavy, if you will.
