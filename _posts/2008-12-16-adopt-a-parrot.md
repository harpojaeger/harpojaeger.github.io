A family friend recently passed away, and we have, for the meantime, adopted her parrot.  It is a stunning creature, with incredible colors, and it makes some amazing noises.  It shrieks very loudly when it is lonely, and you have to go over and talk to it soothingly, and move your head around like a bird, and not look it in the eye, because that is threatening to it.  It also makes an amazingly communicative array of coos and clucks, and rings the bells in its cage with its beak.  I am told that it speaks sometimes, but I haven&#8217;t heard that yet.  Regardless, it is quite a remarkable bird.
