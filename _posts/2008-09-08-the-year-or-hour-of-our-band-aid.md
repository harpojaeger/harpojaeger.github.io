This morning I cut myself on a can of baked beans. As I was going to the bathroom to get a band-aid, I remembered that a friend had recently sent me a very special band-aid in the mail, one decorated with Jesus&#8217; &#8220;visage&#8221;, as she put it. I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect when I opened the package, but I was surprised and pleased beyond my wildest expectations.  
I have no doubt that I will soon make a full recovery.
