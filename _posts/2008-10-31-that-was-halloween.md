Today was Octoberfest, my school&#8217;s annual Halloween/fall/random celebration. Everyone (who is not lame) dresses up in their Halloween costume, and we have no classes in the afternoon, an outdoor open, mic, and other such activities. I was Inigo Montoya, from The Princess Bride.  
This is the first year I can remember that Halloween has not been on a school night. And wouldn&#8217;t you know it, I&#8217;m taking the SATs tomorrow morning, so there will be very little trick-or-treating. I am probably going to go to sleep at about 9:00.
