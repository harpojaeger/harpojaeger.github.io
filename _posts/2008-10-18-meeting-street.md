I was on the phone with a friend who knows Providence and they recommended the Meeting Street Cafe. It turned out that we were around the corner from it, so we are there now, splitting a pastrami sandwich, soup, and coleslaw. There are also, as my friend said, huge cookies, which I think I will sample later.
