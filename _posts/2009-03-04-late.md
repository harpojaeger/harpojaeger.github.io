We won our trial today, and will thus be moving on to the first round of the playoffs on Monday.  We will be playing the winner of Region #16, the Berkshires, which will be either Lennox or Longmeadow; they have a tiebreaker trial.

My plans for tomorrow night are almost completely formed.  I am getting PUMPED!  I am going to go to Ultimate practice before returning home, having dinner with my family, and going back out to the movie.
