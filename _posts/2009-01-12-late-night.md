I have just returned home.  My various meetings went very well, and a couple of us went to see Milk after we had dinner.  I had already seen it, and was happy to do so again.  It did not disappoint.

And now, to bed.  I have to wake up early for school, and I need to pack tomorrow evening.  I was supposed to do it tonight when I got home, but I had not originally planned on going to the movie.  Sleep is more important.
