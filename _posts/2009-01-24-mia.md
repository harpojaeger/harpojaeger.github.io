I have been extremely busy for the past two days with Mock Trial.  We had scrimmages both yesterday and the day before with Holy Name and Newton South, respectively.  Both were extremely productive, and exhausting.  On Thursday I didn&#8217;t get home until after ten.

In other news, my iPhone is, as the name of this post implies, missing in action.  It may have been stolen at school, or it may be in the locked lost-and-found, or it may be in the maintenance supervisor&#8217;s office if the cleaners found it.  I will not know for sure until tomorrow or Monday.  Until then, I am rendered iPwnageless.  I have deactivated my cel service and changed all of my passwords, and now I just have to wait.
