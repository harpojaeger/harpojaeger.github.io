Today was the first day of tryouts for the boys&#8217; ultimate team.  It was mega-cold.  My hands were in excruciating pain by the end of the game.  I CANNOT WAIT for the weather to be uncold again.

I realized that the most scary part about skydiving will definitely be the falling.  I mean, that&#8217;s obvious, but think about it like this: In real life, when you jump off of something, or fall, you are never in free fall for more than about two seconds, usually probably less than one.  When I go skydiving, I will be in free fall for  between thirty seconds and one minute.  Apparently you reach terminal velocity pretty quickly, after something like twenty seconds, and at that point, there is so much air resistance, that you feel as though you are standing on something, but that is still twenty seconds of free fall, far longer than I have ever experienced before.  It is going to be awesome.

Someone I know who has gone skydiving says that once your chute opens, you feel as though gravity has reversed and you are falling up.  I am SO PUMPED!
