I am heading to bed after returning from the concert. We did not, as we had planned, go to Mass MoCA; instead we went to see the Northern Harmony concert in Ashfield, which was excellent. I ran into some friends there as well.  
Tomorrow I am waking up at 9:30 to continue working. I think I will be able to finish the supplements and the Olin application. My plan is to meet with my school&#8217;s college counselor next week to go over my application and check in about my plans for testing and such. I registered for the ACTs today, so I am on track to have all my preparations done within a week or two. Then all that remains is taking the tests. Compared to all of this organizational work, the tests will be easy.
