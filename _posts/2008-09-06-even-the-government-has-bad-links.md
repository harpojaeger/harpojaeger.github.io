The link NASA sent me that would supposedly allow me to submit my &#8220;theory&#8221; did not work.Â  Here&#8217;s the email I sent them:

> Thank you for your prompt response. The link to information on theory  
> submission was very informative. Unfortunately, the first link did  
> not work, so I am unable to continue with submitting my theory.  
> Please let me know how I can go about this. Thank you very much for  
> your time.  
> I eagerly await your response.
