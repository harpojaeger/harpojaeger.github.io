I&#8217;m on FIRE today! Check out my <a href="http://jewschool.com/2010/10/06/24245/forward-and-bjpa-joint-survey-israel-and-park51/" target="_blank">Jewschool post</a> on the Forward/BJPA survey on Jewish attitudes towards Israel and Park51 (two great tastes that taste great together!), as well as my more substantive New Voices <a href="http://blog.newvoices.org/?p=4585" target="_blank">post</a> criticizing the traditional form of Jewish campus opposition to BDS.

More on this blog coming soon  I&#8217;m on a roll with the local zoning stuff&#8230;
