We are on our way out of the hostel where we&#8217;ve been staying since Friday. We recently discovered that some of the plates in the kitchen were manufactured by Prolon, a division of Pro Corp., an old plastics manufacturing company based Florence MA. Not only is Florence right next to where we live, but the Pro building has since been turned into studio spaces, and my father rents one. I figure that the odds of this happening are about the same as us ending up here with that woman from Haydenville, so that&#8217;s twice that we&#8217;ve beaten seemingly insurmountable odds.
