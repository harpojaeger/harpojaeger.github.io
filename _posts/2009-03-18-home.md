I am pretty sick and did not go to school today.  I spent the day at home recuperating, running some errands, and I had a rehearsal this evening.

Last night I had a conversation with my mom about transgender health care, and, after reading articles today about the Pope&#8217;s anti-condom remarks en route to Cameroon, I am pissed off.  People need to realize that some things supersede religion or personal belief.  Human life and health is always more important.  Always.  Whether or not you think people *should *be having sex-changing surgery, the fact is that they do, and if you are a health care provider of any kind, you have a duty to those people that supersedes your beliefs about the morality of what they are doing.  The same holds for religious figures.  If you want to preach abstinence, that&#8217;s fine, but the fact is that condoms save lives, and to tell people in Africa, the continent worst-hit by AIDS, that condoms are &#8220;part of the problem&#8221; (yes, he actually said that), is just plain lying.  That is outside of the realm of belief.  That is false, and it should not be tolerated.
