I am at Penn Station, waiting for my train to board. I printed my ticket using the self-service kiosks, with only a little trouble. The kiosks work fine, except that they require you to insert a credit cars to initialize the process, even if you&#8217;ve already payed online. After inserting the card, you are given the option of buying tickets or printing prepurchased tickets. In my case, this wasn&#8217;t a problem, because even though I didn&#8217;t buy the tickets with my own card, as it doesn&#8217;t work at point-of-sale (it&#8217;s just an ATM card, not a debit), I could still use it to get to the menu to print my ticket. However, if one had bought a ticket using someone else&#8217;s card because one didn&#8217;t have a card at all, they would be rendered unable to use the kiosks. I suppose that is what the ticket windows are for. All the same, it seems like a rather obvious, and easily fixed design flaw. You should only need a card if you need to pay.
