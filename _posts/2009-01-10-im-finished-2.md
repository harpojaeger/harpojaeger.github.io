I turned in my last assignment of the semester yesterday.  It&#8217;s not due until Monday, but I&#8217;m missing the last two days of school (Thursday and Friday), so I figured I&#8217;d get it in early in case it requires revision.  It&#8217;s great to have a weekend without piles of homework to do; I am SO glad to be finished.

Speaking of leaving early, I suppose I should explain.  I&#8217;m going to my aunt&#8217;s wedding in LA on Thursday, so Wednesday will be my last day of school.  My family will be staying in LA until the following Thursday, but I&#8217;ll be flying back early (Monday morning) into DC to meet some friends at the inauguration.

Normally, I try to keep this blog non-partisan.  That is, if I write about current events or politics, I try to do it from an unbiased perspective.  This isn&#8217;t a political blog, so I feel that it&#8217;s important that I don&#8217;t alienate people who disagree with me.

That being said, I will be blogging avidly while I&#8217;m in DC.  I think everyone should appreciate this occasion, whether or not they voted for Obama.  John McCain has been extremely honorable since his defeat, more than once reprimanding conservatives who would smear the incoming administration, and as Americans, I think we all owe it to each other and ourselves to come together.  Obama&#8217;s message of reconciliation and bipartisanship isn&#8217;t trumpeting a new era, it&#8217;s a product of existing sentiments.  People, Democrat and Republican alike, are tired of this internal fighting.  We are turning the page on a new era of brotherhood and cooperation.  Obama is not the herald of a new way, he exists because of the desire for it.

I am very excited to be going to the inauguration, and I hope that others share my excitement in this historic time.  We are faced with challenges of epic proportions, and we have the potential to do epic good.
