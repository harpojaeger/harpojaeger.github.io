I&#8217;ve just finished writing a new contact form for the site. Up until now, I&#8217;ve been using a WordPress plugin to generate the form, but I got tired of not having enough control over it. It seems to work fine, and looks rather similar to the one I had before.  
I also bought a snazzy new Apple Aluminum keyboard and a Bluetooth mouse, taking advantage of my employee discount today at work. They not only look cool, but work much better. Typing is so much easier now, and I have cleared up a significant amount of space &#8211; my old mouse was a Microsoft wireless, and it had a big clunky receiver plugged in. Bluetooth is far superior.  
Bedtime.
