I had an excellent day at Brandeis. I ran into a few people I knew, one who used to go to my school and one who I went to a summer program with a few years ago. I learned a lot about the school, and had a very interesting conversation with some of the computer science faculty. One of the people I talked to also dealt with intellectual property law, something that interests me very much. We talked about this, as well as the Lego Car of Awesomeness, and other topics in computer science and the like.  
I liked the school a lot, and am definitely planning to apply there.  
As to the bed portion of this post, that is where I am imminently headed.
