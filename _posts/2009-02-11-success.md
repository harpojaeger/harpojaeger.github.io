We won our trial today.  One more in the region.  If we win that one, we have a tiebreaker against Tantasqua to determine who proceeds to the playoffs.  Since we have school vacation next week we will be trying to meet at least once or twice to make up for the lost class time.  We might also go bowling.  Fun is an option.

Homework will now ensue.  A two-page scene &#8220;with conflict&#8221; and a paper on the French Revolution.
