I am visiting Brandeis University tomorrow for their open house. Registration is at 10:00, so we&#8217;ll leave around 7 or 7:30 to allow for traffic and the like. I am excited, but tired, and wishing I could have a day off from constantly thinking about college. The pressure never seems to let up.
