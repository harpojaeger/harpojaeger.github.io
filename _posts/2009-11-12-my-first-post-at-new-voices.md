At the J Street conference, I was approached by Ben Sales, the editor of <a href="http://newvoices.org" target="_blank">New Voices</a>, who asked me to <a href="http://blog.newvoices.org" target="_blank">blog</a> for them, and I&#8217;ve just written my <a href="http://blog.newvoices.org/?p=1617" target="_blank">first post for them</a>!  I&#8217;m really excited about this, and I&#8217;ll continue to post here when I write something new over there.  As with Jewschool, I&#8217;m not going to crosspost the content of blog posts, just a link to them.

I encourage everyone to take a look at New Voices.  There&#8217;s some really great stuff over there, and I&#8217;m really happy to be a part of it.
