I&#8217;ve decided not to try and write about all the things I&#8217;ve been doing since I last wrote.  There are too many, and I think it would become to much of just a laundry list.  Instead, I have some stuff to say about what I&#8217;m up to now.  I have graduated, and am done with school.  Tomorrow, however, I&#8217;ll be back in my Rise and Fall of the Great Powers class, presenting my friend and me&#8217;s honors project.  We&#8217;re doing a simulation to demonstrate the creation of the gold standard, which was first instituted in England in 1816/1821, depending on how you look at it.  The next day, I&#8217;ll be back again working with the Holocaust Studies classes.  The one-act I wrote for them is going to be performed that day, and I&#8217;ll spend the first forty-five minutes of each hour-and-a-half-long class working on the play before it&#8217;s performed.  I am super excited for this; I think it&#8217;s going to be really fun and interesting.

I am SO behind on the Sonnet of the Week.  I need to write two every week for FIVE weeks.

Current events things I am thinking about and may write about soon: Sonia Sotomayor, Dick Cheney, the Northampton bike trails projects, environmentalism (as always), and food ethics.
