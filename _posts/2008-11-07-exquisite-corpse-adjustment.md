I&#8217;ve made a minor change to the script that powers the Exquisite Corpse page, because I&#8217;ve noticed a tendency for people to end a lot of poems at once. This is wonderful, except it means that there aren&#8217;t always that many poems running, which can tend to slow stuff down since people start getting their own lines back very quickly. Therefore, I&#8217;ve modified it so that when you submit a line or end a poem, you are then only prompted with the &#8220;start a new poem&#8221; form. It&#8217;s not meant to entirely prevent people from immediately contributing to another poem; you can just click on the link in the sidebar again to completely refresh the page. It&#8217;s just to encourage you to start new poems as well. Hopefully if there are more poems running at once, the general activity will be higher.  
Please feel free to let me know what you think of this feature, as I&#8217;m trying to make this page as simple and effective as possible.
