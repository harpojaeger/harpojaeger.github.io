I wrote an <a href="http://www.newvoices.org/opinion?id=0123" target="_blank">article</a> for New Voices a few days back (and forgot to post the link again). Â This is the one that prompted me to invent the term ambi-Zionism (read my Jewschool post introducing it <a href="http://jewschool.com/2010/05/07/22648/a-new-phrase-for-the-rest-of-us/" target="_blank">here</a>).
