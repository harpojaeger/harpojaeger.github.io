The show was incredible. Definitely ranking with the top shows I&#8217;ve seen (in no particular order):  
Eddie Izzard  
James Brown  
Toots and the Maytals  
They Might Be Giants  
They played a bunch of Byrne and Eno&#8217;s new music, which I didn&#8217;t know very well, but it was fabulous. They also did a bunch of Talking Heads songs, some very similarly to the older rcordings, some reimagined, but all incredibly moving and vitalized.
