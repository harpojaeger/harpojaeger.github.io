Today was the <a href="http://www.northamptonpride.org/" target="_blank">Northampton Pride</a> march and rally. I took a longish lunch break to march with my school&#8217;s GSA, and then got some excellent food, including deep-fried cheesecake, which a friend and I sampled simply so we could say we had. It was not very good. The fried plantains and rice were, however.

And now, for the homework.
