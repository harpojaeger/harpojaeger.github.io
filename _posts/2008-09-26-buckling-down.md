This weekend is crunch time. I will be at home all day Saturday and Sunday working on college applications. I&#8217;ll be going out on Saturday night to see a show at Mass MoCA, but other than that there will be no distractions. My hope is to have all of my applications finished and ready to submit, and my recommendation request forms ready to turn in to teachers and the Guidance office, by the end of the weekend.  
For now, though, I am ready to be done with what was a fulfilling, but exhausting, week.
