I am solidifying plans for my eighteenth birthday.  Here is a list of things I am intending to do, in no particular order:

*   Go skydiving
*   Open a Roth IRA, and potentially a separate investment account
*   Register to vote

I called JumpTown in Orange this evening, and confirmed that part of the plan.  It will cost me $205 to jump as a student, and I will require a twenty to thirty minute training session before going up tandem with an instructor.  I suppose I am thus going to take the day off from school in order to get all of this stuff done.  Also, <a href="http://www.5alone.com" target="_blank">5-Alone</a> has our big show at the <a href="http://www.iheg.com/iron_horse_main.asp" target="_blank">Iron Horse</a> that evening, so it will be a busy day.
