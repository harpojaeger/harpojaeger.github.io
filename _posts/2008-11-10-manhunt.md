Some friends and I played manhunt at school this morning. It was a ton of fun, but I ended up twisting my ankle, which rather hurts now. On the bright side, I have tomorrow off from school. On the other hand, I live next to a graveyard, and they fire off a cannon at six in the morning. I am going to attempt to sleep through it. I suppose we will see if that actually works. I also have a doctor&#8217;s appointment at ten, I may be working in the afternoon, and I have a rehearsal in the evening, so tomorrow&#8217;s not much of a break at all. But it&#8217;s better than nothing.
