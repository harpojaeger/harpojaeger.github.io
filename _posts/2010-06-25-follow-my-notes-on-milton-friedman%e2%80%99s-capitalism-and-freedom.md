I&#8217;ve just started reading *Capitalism and Freedom*, Milton Friedman&#8217;s seminal work which is in many ways the basis of modern free-market economics (Keynes&#8217; *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money* is next).  I&#8217;ll be writing full reviews of both works when I finish them, and eventually (after some more reading and research) comparing them using a variety of methods.  For the moment, however, I&#8217;ve decided to take notes on my reading as I go in order to make the review process easier.  The notes are in a Google Doc, and I&#8217;ve made it publicly accessible, so you can follow along with my thoughts as I go.  The document can be found <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dgsccg68_18f2nmjfc3" target="_blank">here</a>.  I expect to learn a ton from this reading, so I think the notes will be really interesting.

I&#8217;d love to get feedback, so please feel free to get in touch with me however you like: in the comments, on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/renaissanceboy" target="_blank">@renaissanceboy</a>), or whatever.
