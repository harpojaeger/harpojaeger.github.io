Long time passing. My brain is being severely sapped by the college application process. I am doing my best to keep up with it, but it is difficult to stay on top.  
The Exquisite Corpse page is doing very well. I&#8217;ve made a few minor adjustments to the page since it was launched, and I am overall very pleased about how it&#8217;s gone so far. I&#8217;m excited to see it continue.
