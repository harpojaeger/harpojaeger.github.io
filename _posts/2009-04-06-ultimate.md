On Friday we had a double-header game, first playing NMH and then St. Johnsbury.  In the NMH game, we both fielded two teams, and A and a B.  On the A field, we won 11-4, but over on the B field, we were kicked 11-3.  We beat St. Johnsbury though at 6-6 with next point wins, by which time it was completely dark.

Today we played Amherst College B.  Technically they won, but by the end of the game it was a total farce anyway; we made a cup-o-saurus, which is pretty much the best move ever.  It was very muddy, and we played Miniature Tanks afterwards, which was awesome.  Basically what you do is everyone gets on their hands and forearms in a shoulder-to-shoulder circle.  Then everyone starts crawling in towards the center, chanting &#8220;Miniature tanks, miniature tanks, miniature tanks&#8230;&#8221;.  You have to keep going no matter what.  Everyone ends up crawling all over everyone else.  Then a friend and I layed out into some mud, which was also excellent.  However, in the course of the ensuing chest-bump, my right big toe was cleated, and now my nail is coming off, which is extremely painful.  So it goes.

I have no regrets.
