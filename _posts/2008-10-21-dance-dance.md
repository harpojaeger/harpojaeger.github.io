Tonight is Simchat Torah, the festival that marks the completion of the Torah, which is read through once a year. Aside from a service, there is a lot of dancing. My family is probably going to go to the dancing part, because we are all too tired to go to a service.  
I have made a lot of progress on college applications. Last night I finished my essay and got a lot done on application content organization-wise, and I distributed a bunch of forms to teachers today. I have also obtained a copy of a newspaper article about last year&#8217;s Mock Trial finals, which I will be including with my application. It is good to have these things out of the way. I am on track to be done this weekend.
