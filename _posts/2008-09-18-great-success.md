The swing dance was most excellent, even though there were not very many people there. Usually these events are packed, but this one wasn&#8217;t. We had a good time anyway, though. I would have been home a lot sooner but there was a mixup as to where I was dropping off my friends, and I ended up driving around a lot. But it was worth it, because we had an excellent time.  
All in all, a successful night.
