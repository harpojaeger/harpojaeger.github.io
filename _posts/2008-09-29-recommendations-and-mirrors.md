I turned in my various recommendation forms this morning. It is great to have those off of my chest; it severely lightens my load.  
I observed a large curved mirror in the first-floor hallway of my school, which had not been there previously. Upon questioning the principal, who was standing nearby, I learned that it was mounted outside of the maintenance supervisor&#8217;s door so that when he is exiting his room with large boxes he does not hit people.
