Well, now it&#8217;s officially a war.  Israeli ground forces have moved into Gaza.  There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much information on what they&#8217;re doing or where they&#8217;re going, but they&#8217;re there.

The problem is, is there really another way to stop the rockets?  Wouldn&#8217;t we do the same if someone started shooting rockets at us?  The people firing those rockets aren&#8217;t doing it out of retaliation to Israel&#8217;s strikes.  Would a ceasefire really happen?  I don&#8217;t know if those people would ever agree to stop shooting.  Perhaps, grim though this is, it is the only way.
