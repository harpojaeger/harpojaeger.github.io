I have been getting a TON of spam comments on this blog.  They never actually appear on the site, because I mark them as spam and they&#8217;re deleted, but it has been a real pain having to go on here all the time and mark them all.  Therefore, I have installed a new spam-protection device (rather Pythonesque I think; I will refer to it as an SPD).  Now, in order to write a comment, one has to prove one is not a robot by typing in letters from weird pictures.

The SPD (sounds pretty weird, huh?) that I installed is called <a href="http://recaptcha.net/" target="_blank">reCAPTCHA</a>.  It is very interesting in that it uses the input from the user to digitize books.  The database from which it generates the weird pictures contains scans of old books; type that cannot be read by computers and so cannot be digitized.  If enough people enter the same word for a given scanned image, reCAPTCHA assumes that that is the correct word.  So it is both a highly effective SPD and an effective method of harnessing existing technology to do additional useful work.  Pretty fascinating.  And of no end of usefulness to webmasters.  I highly recommend it.
