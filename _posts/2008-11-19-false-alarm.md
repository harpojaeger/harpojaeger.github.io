I just finished reviewing the training materials for my recertification exam, but I can&#8217;t take it now. I will be doing it tomorrow evening, probably. They say that it takes between one and a half and two hours to complete, but I think it will be a lot less; they said that about the certification exams too, and I finished those in about half an hour each.
