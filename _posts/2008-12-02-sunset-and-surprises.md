Coming out of school this evening, there was a beautiful sunset. I took some pictures, one of which is included here.  
I was also reminded on the way home that I am going to a David Byrne concert tonight, which I had managed to completely forget about. I am very excited, especially because Young At Heart, a local old folks&#8217; chorus, is performing (or so I am told). They are always really awesome.
