It&#8217;s been over a week since I wrote, an uncharacteristically long time.  I&#8217;m not going to attempt to write about all the things that have happened since then right now, because I&#8217;m still in the middle of tons of stuff.  Graduation is tomorrow, and I am overloaded with stuff to do.  Sometime in the next few days I hope to write about what I&#8217;ve been doing, as well as some pretty important political and current events topics that have gone down recently.  Also, I&#8217;m pretty behind on the Sonnet of the Week (five weeks delinquent after this week).  A couple weeks ago, as the end of school started to really come close, I decided I&#8217;d have to wait until after graduation to get back to the sonneteering.

This summer, I am planning to start blogging about current events much more regularly.  I am going to have to do some serious thinking about what I want this blog to be like next year.

That&#8217;s all for now.  More to follow.
