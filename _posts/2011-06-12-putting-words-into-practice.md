On the road with limited Internet connectivity right now, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/world/12internet.html?_r=1&hp" target="_blank">this</a> is a big deal:

> The Obama administration is leading a global effort to deploy “shadow” Internet and mobile phone systems that dissidents can use to undermine repressive governments that seek to silence them by censoring or shutting down telecommunications networks.

This is concrete evidence that the current administration really gets how important the Internet can be, and is willing to put time and money into helping people use it even when their governments won&#8217;t.  Says Hillary Clinton:

> &#8220;We see more and more people around the globe using the Internet, mobile phones and other technologies to make their voices heard as they protest against injustice and seek to realize their aspirations,&#8221;

More of this, please.
