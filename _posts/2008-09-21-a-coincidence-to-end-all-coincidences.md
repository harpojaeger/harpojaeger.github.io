Let me begin by drawing your attention to the second category in this post: &#8220;random&#8221;. That us exactly what this is; an explanation of sheer randomness.  
I am on the train; we&#8217;ve just passed through Stamford CT. The train is rather crowded, at least compared to the trip here. This is probably because on the way here, I was starting at the beginning of the route, rather than the middle. But anyway, I jokingly said to the conductor &#8220;What&#8217;re the chances of me finding an empty seat around here?&#8221;, meaning a seat with no one else in the one adjacent. He pointed to an empty seat next to someone else, where I then sat down. Upon conversation, it turned out that the man I was sitting next to is a friend of S. Bear Bergman, the artist-in-residence from the NHC Summer Institute this summer, and, like Bear, performs several one-man shows about queer theory, culture, and history. His name is Peterson Toscano, and he has a pretty cool story behind how he got to be doing what he is. I would recommend checking out his <a href="http://www.petersontoscano.com" target="_blank">website</a>. We talked about tech, blogging, college, and other such things. I think I may get the administration of my school involved with his agent and have him come speak or perform.
