We&#8217;re on our way home after a long and tiring day. On the way here we wrote a song inspired by a sign for Woonsocket. The lyrics are as follows:

> Woonsocket x8â€¢n

where n=number of verses.  
We also passed signs for Purgatory Road and Purgatory Chasm. We thought about going, but decided against it.
