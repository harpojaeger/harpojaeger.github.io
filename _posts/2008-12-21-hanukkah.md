Tonight is the first night of Hannukah. I am looking forward to the food more than anything else, but I did find some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah" target="_blank">very interesting information</a> on what historians now believe to have been the circumstances of the traditional Hannukah story.
