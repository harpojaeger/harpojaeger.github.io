My Sonnet of the Week project continues independently beyond my current semester, which is almost done.  However, I&#8217;ve just handed in the final paper on the project yesterday.  It discusses what I learned from the project, and compares the evolution of my sonnets to that of Shakespeare&#8217;s.  Once I get it back from my teacher, and make any revisions necessary, I will post a copy on the Sonnet of the Week page in PDF form.
