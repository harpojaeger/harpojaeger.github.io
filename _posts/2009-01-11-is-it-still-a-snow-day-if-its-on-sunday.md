My boss just called to say that work is closed today. Will and I will probably do some more work on the website before I leave for a Mock Trial meeting. Will might stick around at my house for the afternoon, since our old calc class has a reunion this evening. Coincedentally, it is at the same place as my Mock Trial meeting, so I&#8217;ll be spending the whole day at home and there.
