If you <a href="http://twitter.com/renaissanceboy" target="_blank">follow me on Twitter</a>, you might know about the arson attacks that happened in Northampton early this morning.  I&#8217;ve been posting pictures and information, and there&#8217;s already a <a href="http://twitter.com/01060support" target="_blank">Twitter account created for them</a>, a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=108096318570135017840.00047bb8cfaa22b7e9886&z=15" target="_blank">community-maintained Google Map of incidents</a>, and a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=224400058116&ref=nf" target="_blank">Facebook group</a>.  Here are links to <a href="http://gazettenet.com/2009/12/26/two-northampton-men-die-today-string-suspicious-fires-police-can" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="http://www.wwlp.com/dpp/news/local/residents-in-fear-following-fires" target="_blank">articles</a> <a href="http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/12/fires_investigated_in_northamp.html" target="_blank">about</a> the fires for more information.

If you&#8217;re in the are, please get involved.  This is a senseless tragedy, and we need to help the victims.  I&#8217;m working on organizing a community patrol of some sort, perhaps involved with the Northampton Police department.  Keep an eye on my Twitter for more info, and I&#8217;ll try to post here if I can.
