I&#8217;ve spent months trying out free iPhone RSS readers, and comparing specs and capabilities of all the paid ones, trying to decide if I should invest, continue using one of the free ones (I&#8217;ve tried <a href="http://www.newsgator.com" target="_blank">NewsGator</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/netnewswireiphone/default.aspx" target="_blank">NetNewsWire for iPhone</a> and <a href="http://www.oualid.net" target="_blank">Simon Oualid</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.oualid.net/iphone-rss-reader/" target="_blank">Free RSS Reader</a>), or write my own once I get an Intel Mac.  Last night I realized that I should just use Google Reader.  This has the advantage of being an online service, so I can get to it from anywhere and not have to read the same articles over and over.  It&#8217;s fast, powerful, and the mobile interface is very user-friendly.

Occurrences of this nature seem to be rather common.  I become frustrated with the available options for a certain task, and begin looking for other solutions.  I spend a while jumping between solutions, beating myself over the head, and considering writing my own (which is not always feasible), and then realize that Google makes a free product that is better than any of the others.  I had this experience with Gmail and Google&#8217;s movie showtimes tool.  Picasa, Google Calendar, and Google Docs aren&#8217;t quite there yet, but I think they will be soon.

Here&#8217;s to the next generation of web-based apps.  Centralization and reduction of client-side data processing are the way forward.
