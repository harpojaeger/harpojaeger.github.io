King Lear was awesome. The cast was extremely solid, and the director (Keith Langsdale) did a wonderful job with the concept. The flow was also great; the actors did a superb job of keeping the play moving. It was modernized, with most of the characters in suits or dress clothing, and cellphones used as the messages from the original text. The fool was also very interesting; sort of punked out, with a lot of makeup, zippers, and ripped clothing. A wonderful show, all in all.  
Also, the scene in which Cornwall puts out Gloucester&#8217;s eyes contains three of Shakespeare&#8217;s best lines: &#8220;Oh, I am slain!&#8221;, &#8220;Out, vile jelly!&#8221;, and &#8220;I have received a hurt&#8221;. Pure poetry.  
Will and I did some physics work this evening, and will work on the LC(A) tomorrow morning. Bed is nigh.
