This makes the second election in a row where a nominee has been accused of being a &#8220;flip-flop&#8221;. Stepping outside of my personal political views, I think it makes sense to support someone whose opinions change. History (and common sense) show that when someone refuses to change their opinion in the face of overwhelming evidence, the consequences are dire. By accusing someone of being a &#8220;flip-flop&#8221; you are essentially saying &#8220;Your beliefs have changed over time, therefore they are not valid&#8221;, when we should really be commending them for changing what they think. It shows that they are open-minded, and willing to consider all options, rather than desirous of pursuing their own personal agenda at all costs. That&#8217;s the sort of person who should be leading our country. Vote 2008!
