We won!  WAHOO!

I didn&#8217;t get home until about eleven last night, and I have been getting sicker and sicker since yesterday morning.  I only got out of bed about forty-five minutes ago.  Today I am going to be catching up on my independent study work, which I have greatly neglected in recent months.  After that, I will be going to Costco to get new glasses.  When I return, I will do more homework.

No rest for the weary.

Also, this is the best headline ever.  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7853564.stm" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7853564.stm</a>
