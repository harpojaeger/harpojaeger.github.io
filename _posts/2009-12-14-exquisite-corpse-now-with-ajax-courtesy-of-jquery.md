If you check out the [Exquisite Corpse page][1], you will notice some pretty friggin&#8217; awesome updates.  It is now ENTIRELY <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)" target="_blank">Ajax</a>-based.  This means that you don&#8217;t EVER have to reload the page to get a new poem or submit lines, and there will be no more of the obnoxious thing where after someone submits a line of a poem, they click refresh a bunch of times to get a new prompt line, and then the line they entered gets added on over and over again because they&#8217;re resubmitting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)" target="_blank">POST</a> data over and over.  No, no more!  <a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> to the rescue!

If this doesn&#8217;t make any sense to you, that&#8217;s okay.  The upshot of it for an end user is that the page is way more user-friendly, has some sizzling-hot visual effects (yes, Mr. Spinning-Gear-Progress-Indicator, and Ms. Snazzy-Awesome-Slide-Up-and-Slide-Down-to-Respectively-Hide-and-Show-Content, I&#8217;m talking about you), tracks when a poem was *begun*, not just when it was ended, and is just generally slicker.  Enjoy!

I&#8217;ve tested the page pretty thoroughly, and I don&#8217;t anticipate any problems.  However, if you do run across something, please let me know using the <a href="http://www.harpojaeger.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact form</a>.

Keep up the good work!  This project has been pretty incredible, and I hope that people will continue to contribute to it.
