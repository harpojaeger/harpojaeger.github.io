I am home from school today; I was up all night coughing and the like. I am hoping this is the worst this thing will get. I thought the pertussis was on the run, but it seems that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan#A_New_Hope" target="_blank">if you strike it down, it shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine</a>. Whatever the case, my cough has worsened significantly.  
I think a slow day is probably a good thing anyway. I need a bit of time to catch up on college work, generally relax, and drink tea (although we are out of honey).
