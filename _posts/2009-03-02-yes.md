I have finally <a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/axlin/2008/03/29/os-x-force-safari-to-use-a-single-window/" target="_blank">found out how</a> to do something I have been trying to do for a LONG time.  Safari, the web browser that I use, has tabbed browsing capability (and I use it primarily), but does not, as, for instance, Firefox does, force any link set to open in a new window (target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;) to open instead in a new tab.  It turns out there&#8217;s a hidden feature for it:

> defaults write com.apple.Safari TargetedClicksCreateTabs -bool true

This makes my life SO much better.
