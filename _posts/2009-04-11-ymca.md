Of course they would be closed on Easter Sunday.  Why on earth didn&#8217;t I think of that?

I had planned my whole day around going to the Y in the morning, then work, then a mock trial meeting.  But it turns out that the Y is closed, work is closed, and the meeting is not happening.  It looks as though I will be going up to Ashfield to dig some holes in the morning.  Then I will do homework before meeting with a friend to work on our honors project.
