I am still slogging knee-deep through miles of college applications. I have completed the main section of the Common Application, and the first draft of my main essay, and I&#8217;m now beginning the rather repetitive process of filling out the various supplements. Seven out of the nine schools I am applying to through Common App have their own supplements. I just went through and filled out all of the biographical, multiple choice, and short-answer-type questions in the supplements, and now I&#8217;m starting the various essays. This is going to be a long process.  
It seems to me that the supplement sort of defeats the purpose of the Common App. The whole point is the admission that all of the schools can use the same data and come to different conclusions if they wish to. The Common App simply exists to make it easier for students to submit applications, and the supplements work counter to that. At least they are not as long as the main application, but they are still inconvenient.
