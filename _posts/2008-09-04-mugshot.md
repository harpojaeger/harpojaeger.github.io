This morning my sister asked what &#8220;mug&#8221; meant in the context of &#8220;face&#8221;. I realized I didn&#8217;t really know why it meant this.  My father pointed out that it could have been because &#8220;mug&#8221; meant a criminal, as in getting mugged or a mugshot, and then &#8220;mug&#8221; could have changed to mean &#8220;face&#8221; because mugshots are just pictures of faces.

Who knows?  This is a job for&#8230;WIKIPEDIA-MAN!
