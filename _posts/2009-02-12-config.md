I am leaving the house in a little while for some freelance work. School was tiring today, but very productive, especially Mock Trial. We debriefed (a rather silly word) about yesterday&#8217;s trial, and we are working on our plans for meeting several times over next week&#8217;s vacation. I have also almost finished working out my work schedule for next week.
