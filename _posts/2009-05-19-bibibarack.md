The media is calling it a big change in U.S.-Israeli relations.  I like that, but I&#8217;m not sure how true it is.  On the other hand, it&#8217;s too early to judge, whether optimistically or pessimistically, how U.S.-Israeli relations are going to evolve from here.  I think it&#8217;s important that Obama&#8217;s called for an end to the settlements in strong terms.  But I dislike that the Israel is trying to shift the focus entirely to Iran.  Iran is definitely an issue, but Israel makes it sound as though they are the only thing that matters.  Obviously, they are trying to shift the focus from their own problems, and I&#8217;ve had enough of that.  I think Obama has too.  One reason I appreciate the diplomatic work he&#8217;s doing is that he&#8217;s got priorities, but he doesn&#8217;t let them get in the way of actual diplomacy.  He understands that you work towards a goal for the future using the tools of today.  Those tools include by necessity diplomacy.  We can&#8217;t ignore our problems any more.

I guess the upshot of this is that I&#8217;m hopeful we can set the stage for some real pressure on Israel to shape up.  I&#8217;m not counting on it happening overnight, but I&#8217;m ready to hold the Obama administration to a high standard on its timely and effective accomplishment.

In a side note, I&#8217;m worried about the denial of funds for closing Guantanamo.  I haven&#8217;t found out enough about it yet to know who to look to for an explanation, but it&#8217;s a big deal.
