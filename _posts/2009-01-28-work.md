Because of the snow, very few people were able to come to the meeting, so it quickly degenerated into watching The Daily Show, and snowball fights. We walked over to a nearby friend and teammate&#8217;s house with a ladder, intending to lay siege to his bedroom, but since he was downstairs, we had to settle for a gigantic snow battle, after which we drank a great deal of hot chocolate, ate popcorn, and watched Firefly.

All in all, a successful afternoon.
