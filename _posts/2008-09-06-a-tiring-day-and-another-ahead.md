I spent the day working on college essays.  It was rather monotonous.  Tomorrow will also be tiring, although much more interesting.  I&#8217;ll be at school all day working on a show.  In the morning we are cuing, and after noon when the actors leave, we will be setting up some A/V equipment.  I don&#8217;t know how long I&#8217;ll be there, but I imagine I will be exhausted.

And I didn&#8217;t do any homework today.
