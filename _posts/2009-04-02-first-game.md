We won our first game of the season!  It was an awesome one, against Longmeadow B.  It was pretty great that it was not a pushover; we were quite evenly matched and the game was intense.  Also, I layed out for the first point of the season!  I am extremely proud.  And dirty.  My glasses are pretty destroyed, having been stepped on and dirtified rather well.

Today I played an excellent game of Apples to Apples.  I won.  Here, then, is a list of my qualities, as expressed by the infallible and omnipotent logic of Apples to Apples:

1.  Crazed
2.  Masculine
3.  Smooth
4.  Influential
5.  Misunderstood
6.  Wild
7.  Important
8.  Offensive
9.  Primitive
10. Hilarious
11. Nerdy
12. Frightening
13. Powerful

The Mock Trial team is entering an invitational tournament in New Jersey.  We got the case today.  It is negligence!

I am now able to moonwalk.
