Will Szal and I (of <a title="Lego Car of Awesomeness" rel="self" href="/projects/lego">Lego Car of Awesomeness</a> fame) will be purchasing iPhones on Friday morning when they are released. To this effect, we are camping out in front of the AT&T store on Thursday night to get in line. Lyle (also of the Awesomeness crew) may be joining us, although he&#8217;s not buying a phone himself. Will has a laptop, so I may try to figure out a way to blog while I&#8217;m there. Either way, it will be AWESOME.
