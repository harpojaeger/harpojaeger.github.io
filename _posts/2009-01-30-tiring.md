What an exhausting week. We have been working very hard at school, and combined with the fact that I&#8217;m getting very little physical exercise in the winter, I have been both physically and mentally worn-out. It will be good to have a calming night tonight.

Tomorrow I will be in Boston all day at the Berklee High School Jazz competition. This will be a ton of fun, especially if we win. It will be fun even if we don&#8217;t, though; we will get to see a ton of really good music, and generally have an exciting time.

I have been working on a really cool piece of code that I hope to finish soon. When I do, I am going to put it up in the Projects section. It is based on software that I saw demonstrated at Olin College of Engineering when I toured there. I will say no more until it is finished, but it is really awesome.
