I have only just woken up, so I have only have the day left to do homework.  This is alright with me.  I am very excited for this afternoon, however, because for Hannukah, my parents renewed our family&#8217;s membership to the YMCA, and I will be going this afternoon.  It has been over a year since our membership expired, and I have missed it.  Especially in the winter, when I don&#8217;t get out of the house or bike as much.
