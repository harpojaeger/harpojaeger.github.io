The information session was a success, inasmuch as any of these things can be. I learned a lot, and I am glad I went. I am going to head home now, and get to school in time for my last class, Social Dance.  
Overall, this visit was a lot of fun. I learned a lot about the school and myself in that I was really living the experience of being in college. I am going to be glad to be home, though.
