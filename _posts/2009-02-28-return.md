It has been almost a week since I wrote a post that was an actual post, not a sonnet.  It has been nice to have a break, because I am still gathering my thoughts about how I want to continue blogging, and what form I want this blog to take in the future.  Once I go to college, I think it will probably start to focus more on the things I am working on there.  I am also thinking of starting some kind of separate political blog, whether associated with Brown or not, or perhaps just starting to write more about politics on this blog.

In other news, I am going to see Watchmen at midnight on opening night.  I am approximately as excited as I was for Quantum of Solace, and I have heard good things about this film.
