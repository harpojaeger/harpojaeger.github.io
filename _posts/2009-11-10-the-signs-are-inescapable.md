I&#8217;d say that the fact that Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan was a Muslim is a lot less important than the fact that he was an Army psychiatrist.  His *entire job* is *preventing* people from feeling that they have to do *exactly* what he did.

Coincedence?  No.  When people with the training to assess and treat psychological syndromes like PTSD succumb to them, something is seriously wrong. Military suicides are <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28895624/" target="_blank">already</a> going way <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/03/18/military.suicides/" target="_blank">up</a>.  Afghanistan isn&#8217;t the good fight anymore.   Service members are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/26/AR2009102603394.html" target="_blank">speaking</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gVNRczp2rray24sNkzCwAGXP_4jQ" target="_blank">out</a> following their experiences there.  There was a time when we could have done good there.  That time is over.

<a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070110-7.html" target="_blank">Bush didn&#8217;t care about the troops enough to bring them home.  Instead, he deployed more.</a> And that doesn&#8217;t just mean that a bunch of them suddenly just materialized.  Tours got longer.  Time between them got shorter.

Obama, don&#8217;t make the same mistake.   The deceptively low (considering the length of the engagement [and especially when compared to Iraq]) casualty figures are only or side of the story.  This war is driving the country deeper into depression.   It&#8217;s driving a wedge between us and our allies (cite BBC), not to mention the Muslim world.   And it&#8217;s putting an unsustainable strain on our military.

You have the power to end it now.  Do it before it&#8217;s too late.
