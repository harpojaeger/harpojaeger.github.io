And here begins my first post from the <a href="http://havurah.org" target="_blank">NHC</a> <a href="http://havurah.org/institute" target="_blank">Summer Institute 2009</a>!  So far, the program is off to a fabulous start.  I&#8217;m meeting a lot of new people, more than in past years, which is interesting.  I think my sort of circle of teen friends is making a more concerted effort to expand ourselves this year.  Needless to say, it&#8217;s been fabulous reconnecting with old friends.  It looks to be a terrific week, between my <a href="http://havurah.org/institute2009/courses/mitzvah-challah-bread-making-and-sacred-eating" target="_blank">awesome</a> <a href="http://havurah.org/institute2009/courses/shabbat-land-shemitah-21st-century" target="_blank">classes</a>, the facilitated dialogue re: &#8220;Israeli-Palestinian conflict&#8221;, and the general atmosphere of interesting people doing interesting things.

In other, extremely exciting news, I am going to start blogging at <a href="http://jewschool.com" target="_blank">Jewschool</a>!  A while back, I let <a href="http://judaismwithoutborders.org" target="_blank">Ben Murane</a> know that I was interested in writing for them (I&#8217;ve been reading it for a while), and when I saw him today, he said they said yes.  I am uber-pumped to get started.  I don&#8217;t really know any details yet, but I am going to talk to a bunch of people who are part of the editorial comittee this week to find out more.  I suppose I&#8217;ll write more when I know more.

So, in summary, I am looking forward to a terrific week of various awesome things, which I will write more about as they occur.  For now, I will sleep.
