I am proud of both candidates for staying away from personal attacks in tonight&#8217;s presidential debate. It was remarkably centered on the issues. Both, of course, did their fair share of misrepresenting the other&#8217;s arguments and record, but this is to be expected even in such a situation. I credit them both with putting a great deal of effort into launching substantive attacks on the other&#8217;s position whenever applicable. I have a lot of hope for the future of American politics no matter who wins.
