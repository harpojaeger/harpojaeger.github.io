Today in the car my father and I developed a theory in the car on the way to school.  We think that if Mickey and Minney Mouse were launched into space and started a new race, this race would count in base six, since Mickey and Minnie mouse have only three fingers on each hand.  I am calling NASA about this to see what they say.
