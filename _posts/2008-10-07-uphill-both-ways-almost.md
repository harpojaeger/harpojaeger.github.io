After getting home at about 12:45 today, I decided to bike to school in time for my social dance class. I have just returned now; it was extremely tiring. I took Route 5, so it&#8217;s about 30 miles round trip. I noticed lots of things along the road that I never see when I&#8217;m driving, like small streams and such. There was also more roadkill than I remembered, but I guess you can see that better when you&#8217;re on a bike. I stopped to get a slice of pizza in Northampton before returning home. I am planning to watch or listen to the debate tonight, to which I am looking forward.
