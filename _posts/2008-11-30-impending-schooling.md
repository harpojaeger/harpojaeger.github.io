I am pretty excited to see all of my friends tomorrow. It will be good to get back into the academic rhythm of things. I recently confirmed that all of my school&#8217;s materials (recommendations, transcript, etc.) have been sent into Brown admissions. I will be hearing back from them in about two weeks.  
1776 is a fabulous show. It makes me proud to be an American.
