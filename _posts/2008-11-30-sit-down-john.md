I got off work early today, and spent the afternoon hanging around at home, gathering potential photos for my senior page in the yearbook (which is due in only a few weeks), and just chilling. Being unproductive is very rewarding. However, so is being productive; I went back out to do some freelance computer work at 4:15. Now I am going to watch 1776; a rather wonderful show.  
School begins again tomorrow.
