I&#8217;m at the Hotel Northampton waiting to give blood with two other friends. I would take some pictures, but I think that would be a violation of people&#8217;s privacy.  
We filled out a short form, and now have to have an interview with Red Cross workers before we actually get the blood drawn. When we got here, they told us the wait would be about 45 minutes; this was about 25 minutes ago. The three of us got food before we came here, and I&#8217;m meeting my family afterwards to sample a new hamburger joint in town.
