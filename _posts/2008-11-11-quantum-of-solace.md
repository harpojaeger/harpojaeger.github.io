I am going to the midnight showing of the new James Bond movie on Thursday night (technically Friday morning) at 12:01 AM with a friend from school. I am PUMPED! Apparently it is the shortest Bond film ever, which is pretty cool. I really like Daniel Craig, the new actor, and I like the direction they went with the last film. From what I hear, this one&#8217;s similar.  
Craig really plays Bond like a character, rather than just trying to be more manly than Sean Connery (which is not possible) like every other actor before him did. This makes the movies a lot more interesting, and very refreshing, especially when you are, like myself, a total Bond fanatic (I had seen every movie by the time I was 12).
