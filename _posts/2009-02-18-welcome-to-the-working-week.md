Man, what an exhausting couple of days.  Between two full time work days (another tomorrow), Mock Trial, and the first episode of Joss Whedon&#8217;s new show, Dollhouse, I am wiped out.

Recently I have been doing a lot of thinking about what the purpose of blogging is.  I am still not sure.  I know that I find it interesting because of the potential to act as both an extroverted and introverted journal simultaneously, but there is a lot of other potential, and a lot of other considerations.  For instance, does one target the entries towards other people, or should it be more of a picture of what the author is thinking?  Are they mutually exclusive?  Ultimately I don&#8217;t think they are, but there&#8217;s a fine line between revealing your thoughts and acting like other people don&#8217;t exist.

I think I will probably write some more about this topic in the future.
