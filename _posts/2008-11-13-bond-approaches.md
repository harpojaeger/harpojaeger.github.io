My plan for this evening is to do a bit of work, until about 7:30 or 8:00, nap until just before 11, and then get up and go to the movie. I am VERY excited. I am picking up two friends on the way, and we are meeting at least one other person there, possibly more. It is going to be a great night.  
I also had the chance to do something that I&#8217;ve been hoping to do for a while. I received a chain letter via email from a family friend, successfully looked it up and confirmed its falsehood via <a href="http://www.snopes.com" target="_blank">Snopes</a>, and sent the link back to my friend. Snopes is a wonderful rumor-tracking website, useful for such things as chain letters and various online hoaxes. They maintain a database with user-submitted rumor reports, descriptions of what you, the user, are likely to see, and its status: confirmed true, false, unknown, etc., along with supporting facts and arguments. It is very informative, and some of the stuff on there is just plain hilarious; you don&#8217;t realize exactly how ridiculous this stuff is until you see it debunked.
