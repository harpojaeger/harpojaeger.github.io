Hi everyone. My name is Harpo Jaeger. I&#8217;m a new poster on Jewschool. I&#8217;ve been blogging for a little over a year now at my personal website,<a href="http://www.harpojaeger.com" target="_blank">harpojaeger.com</a>. I&#8217;m really excited to start blogging here! Some of the other Jewschoolers I know from the<a href="http://havurah.org" target="_blank">NHC</a><a href="http://havurah.org/institute" target="_blank">Summer Institute</a>, some I don&#8217;t know at all.

At some point in the future I&#8217;ll be updating my biographical information, but right now I am here with the intention of posting about something very specific.

Being a pluralistic community, the Summer Institute (which I&#8217;m currently at) has some interesting halakhic quirks. For the members who don&#8217;t carry items on Shabbes, we create an<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruv" target="_blank">eruv</a>, a quasi-physical boundary around the campus that halakically turns the campus into one building, thus allowing those people to carry siddurim, a talit, and so on, between buildings. For several years, I&#8217;ve been a coordinator of this construction process, and I&#8217;ve learned a lot from it. BZ suggested I write a post about this, as a sort of &#8220;DIY eruv&#8221;, which is a very good way of putting it, so here it is.

The essential idea of an eruv is a series of simulated doors. To do this, we use a series of*lecha&#8217;in*(singular*lechi*, which translates as &#8220;doorpost&#8221;), with string run over the tops, representing the header of the door frame. There are various other components of the eruv in addition to sticks and string. For instance, a hill can act as a natural boundary around an area if it is steep enough. Part of the campus here is on a steep hill, so we can place a*lechi*at either end and use the hill as a go-between. Additionally, an existing cable such as a telephone wire can be used if a*lechi*is placed below it and the cable sags less than about eleven inches (inaccuracy due to conversion from biblical units of measure).

What&#8217;s interesting about the process we&#8217;ve gone through is that neither myself or my friend with whom I coordinate have a great deal of experience with this halakha. We&#8217;ve learned it from those who do, we&#8217;ve internalized it, and at this point it&#8217;s become a DIY ritual more than anything else. Without having a pre-existing complete grasp of the spiritual and traditional elements of the eruv, we are able to create one that is completely in line with all of the requirements. Also, it&#8217;s pretty fun. We stay up late drinking tons of caffeinated beverages, drive around in a golf cart with lumber and power tools, drive around the perimeter with one of the halakhic experts to verify the whole thing, and then sanctify it by saying a blessing (*al mitzvat eruv*) over a &#8220;communal meal&#8221; (in today&#8217;s case, half a bagel left over from yesterday&#8217;s sunrise hike up Mt. Monadnock). That meal is then eaten after the eruv no longer needs to be sanctified (although I anticipate the bagel being rather stale by then).

So, starting from a mere interest in construction, and with the counseling of some persons with more halakhic knowledge, we&#8217;ve learned a lot about the practice, had a bunch of fun, and helped some of our co-Institute-goers observe Shabbes more easily.

If you have the opportunity, I&#8217;d highly recommend getting involved in the construction of a local eruv. It&#8217;s a fabulous way to learn about some very interesting halakha and its modern implementations, as well as explore a host of pluralistic issues. Great all around.

That&#8217;s all for now. It is time to light candles here, and I must away. I hope this first post is food for thought, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to writing here. Shabbat shalom!
