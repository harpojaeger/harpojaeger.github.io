I am going to a friend&#8217;s Boxing Day party this evening. Boxing Day is a rather archaic holiday, still celebrated in Europe and other parts of the world, but not America. It has its origins in the tradition of giving presents to those less fortunate than yourself; it may have roots in the Roman festival of Saturnalia, which involved masters and slaves switching roles.  
I am not really sure what a Boxing Day party will entail, as I&#8217;ve never really experienced it before, but I am interested to find out. I think there will be food.
