I have been working on college applications all day. I&#8217;m taking a break now. I was out of the house for a little while, and I&#8217;m waiting for a free computer to get back to work. I&#8217;m visiting Olin tomorrow, and possibly staying the night, so I need to have everything finished tonight. Fortunately, my father has taken over the CSS profile, which saves me a lot of number crunching, but it is a rather lengthy process.
