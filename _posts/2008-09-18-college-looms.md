I have a meeting this morning with my college advisor at school this morning to talk about my &#8220;testing strategies&#8221; and such. Although I have been thinking about and working in this kind of thing for a while, it is a little bit freaky to have this meeting; it really solidifies things beyond the point of denial or avoidance. Not that I would have been intentionally in denial or avoiding the facts, but on some subconscious level, I don&#8217;t think anyone thinks this kind of thing is completely real until it hits them in the face. So now I have been hit in the face.
