In the spirit of full disclosure, I am probably going to switch to a different web host sometime soon.  Currently, I use GoDaddy to host this site, and the harpojaeger.com domain is also registered with them.  renaissanceboy.org, my first domain, which now redirects here, is registered with DirectNic, the company I was using at the time.

The reasons I want to switch are complicated.  For a while, I&#8217;ve been impressed by GoDaddy&#8217;s low prices but dismayed by their site&#8217;s operation in a technical sense; it is confusing and slow.  In addition, I have never been fully supportive of their marketing techniques, which are frequently subtly, sometimes blatantly, sexist, base, and calculative.  I have never really devoted much thought to it, but my father mentioned to me that there was a movement afoot to ditch GoDaddy because of these tactics, and he directed me to <a href="http://glenniacampbell.typepad.com/silenti/2009/02/godaddysucks.html" target="_blank">this</a> article.  It sums up the issues at play very well.

I was already aware of <a href="http://dreamhost.com/" target="_blank">DreamHost</a>, having worked for a client who used it, and the other hosting service the article linked to, <a href="http://www.lunarpages.com/" target="_blank">LunarPages</a>, looks excellent as well.  I am going to spend some time in the near future researching different services, and will probably make the switch soon.  I think I will also consolidate all of my domain names to the same registrar, ideally the same company that&#8217;s doing the hosting.  This should make stuff a lot easier.
