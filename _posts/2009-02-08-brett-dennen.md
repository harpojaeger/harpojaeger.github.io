This was a fabulous show.  Brett Dennen is sort of like David Byrne crossed with Ted Hawkins.  Also, his guitarist is from Chicopee.

The show was a mix of more pop-ish music and a sort of very heavily salsa-influenced strain, which I really liked.  Brett&#8217;s voice seemed suited to both; he was able to pull of the pop stuff and still maintain musical respectability (which can be difficult), and he could also switch to the more melodic feel of the salsa.  Lead vocals for salsa have a unique quality in that they always sound as though they are falling.  The voice sort of takes up a space and then gently falls out of it.  It is a very graceful sound, and one that not many artists can create.  Both the band and Brett were really good at this.

The opener, Angel Taylor, was awesome.  She had a two-track EP for free, so I snagged a copy, and it is great.  And I singed up for her mailing list so I got a free MP3 of another track, which is also excellent.

Another thing that is excellent is sleep.  And the word &#8220;promulgate&#8221;.
