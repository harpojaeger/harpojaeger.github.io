I&#8217;ve made a small update to the [Exquisite Corpse page][1], one that I had been considering for a while.  All poems completed from this point onwards will display a timestamp showing when they were completed.

Activity on the page has been pretty steady recently, which is great.  I&#8217;m really pleased with how that project is going.  Please share it with your friends &#8211; it&#8217;s really becoming something pretty awesome.  Keep up the good work!
