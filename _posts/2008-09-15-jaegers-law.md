Based on my experience at the strike yesterday, and the show in general, I have created a law that applies to the use of tie line (the cord that is used for hanging cable in theaters). It is called &#8220;Harpo Jaeger&#8217;s Law of Tie Line Use&#8221; (or &#8220;Jaeger&#8217;s Law&#8221; for short), and reads:

> You always need more tie line than you think, even if you take into account Jaeger&#8217;s law.
