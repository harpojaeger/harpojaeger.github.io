I&#8217;m back in town after the show (which was a smashing success) and strike (also a smashing success, and about as lengthy), and that same piano player is playing in the same place on the street.  
Having coiled the longest S-Video cable known to mankind (125&#8242; [to say nothing of the show or the rest of the strike]), I am very tired, and it is nice to know that some things remain the same.
