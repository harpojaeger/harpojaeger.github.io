Tonight begins Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. We will again be shutting off all electronics at dinner before we leave for synagogue. Tomorrow is a fast day, and we will break the fast at home in the evening. I am heading out to do a few errands before dinner, and I think I will spend the day tomorrow reading, writing, and thinking.
