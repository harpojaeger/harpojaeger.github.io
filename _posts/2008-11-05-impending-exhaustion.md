I had a very tiring day today, and I am heading to bed early. I have a meeting tomorrow with my guidance / college counselor.  
I haven&#8217;t minded dealing with and thinking about my application recently, because it&#8217;s already submitted. I&#8217;m actually excited to talk about it tomorrow morning, especially because I recently realized that I will hear back from Brown in only about five weeks.
