I live down the street from the Fairgrounds, so today when I got home I took my younger sister to the Annual 3-County Fair. Although I of course enjoyed the requisite fried dough and cotton candy, I felt a sense of privilege while there. All of my rides were operated by very nice, overworked, and presumably underpaid, black and Latin men. I was surrounded by blond children named Courtney, Tiffany, Brittney, etc. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a little bit bourgeoisie as I climbed off the Ferris wheel with my sister for the second time, thanking the operator, and thinking about how many more children and couples he would open the gondola door for before the fair closed.  
I am at home now, and my mother has taken my sister back, as she wanted to be there in the evening. I agree, the fair is wonderful at night when all the rides are illuminated, but I didn&#8217;t feel up to going back. Maybe next year.
