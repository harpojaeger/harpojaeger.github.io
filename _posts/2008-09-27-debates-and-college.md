I watched the first presidential debate last night between McCain and Obama. Disregarding the candidates&#8217; actual positions on the issues, I was a pretty fed up with the format of the debate. It really represents the way the whole campaign process is run. The candidates have to dodge around the real substance of debate, which is telling the other person that they are wrong, and resort to this weird combination of sarcasm and feigned ignorance, using phrases like &#8220;I don&#8217;t think he understands&#8221; and &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about my opponent, but I&#8230;&#8221;, instead of saying &#8220;Your are incorrect. Your position on issue X is wrong because of reason Y. My position is correct because of reason Z&#8221;. This annoys me, because it short-changes the people watching the debates; we don&#8217;t get an accurate picture of who thinks what or who&#8217;s right and who&#8217;s wrong.  
In other news, my college applications are coming along well. I have a friend coming over at one, who will be coming to the show tonight, but he is bringing a bunch of work he has to do as well, so we will not be hanging out as much as working in the same area. I am looking forward to the show tonight; it will be a good way to relax after a long day of monotonous work. There are some very interesting exhibits in the galleries as Mass MoCA right now as well, so we&#8217;ll be going a bit early to see them. One of them, by Jenny Holzer, is a huge darkened room filled with beanbag chairs. Poems are projected moving over the floor and walls from two projectors at either end. I saw this one before, but would like to see it again. There is also a back room to this exhibit that I neglected to see the first time.
