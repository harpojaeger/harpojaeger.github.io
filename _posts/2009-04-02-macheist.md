I just purchased the <a href="http://www.macheist.com/" target="_blank">MacHeist</a> bundle.  I am not using all of the apps in it, but just for the ones I am using, $39 is a fabulous price.  As <a href="http://twitter.com/wilw" target="_blank">Wil Wheaton</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/wilw/status/1432073057" target="_blank">said</a>, I really hope that BoinxTV gets unlocked.  Anyone who has a Mac should by this package, save a bunch of money, help charity, and get awesome apps.
