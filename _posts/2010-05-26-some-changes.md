It&#8217;s been a little while since I posted here, due to the end of school and associated craziness.  I&#8217;m going to be taking next year off from school to work and travel, and another one of my goals is to write much more regularly, and to start making money, or at least breaking even, on this site.  I&#8217;ve been accepted as a <a href="http://www.projectwonderful.com/" target="_blank">Project Wonderful</a> advertiser, so you should start seeing some interesting ads on this site soon.

I&#8217;ve also finally gotten around to ditching <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">GoDaddy.com</a> as the host of my website and the harpojaeger.com domain name.  I&#8217;ve never particularly liked their backend and other user tools, and they have some rather sexist and objectifying advertisements that I objected to.  A while back, <a href="http://trickfilm.org" target="_blank">my dad</a> came across a blog <a href="http://glenniacampbell.typepad.com/silenti/2009/02/transferring-domain-name-from-godaddy-to-registercom-phase-i.html" target="_blank">post regarding similar issues</a>, which he passed on to me.  I read it at the time (3/9/09 [and it's been in my Gmail Starred items since then]) and decided to switch, and it&#8217;s now done.  I also moved renaissanceboy.org over from <a href="http://www.directnic.com/" target="_blank">directNIC</a>, for simplicity&#8217;s sake (it redirects here).  I&#8217;ve opted to use <a href="http://www.bluehost.com/" target="_blank">BlueHost</a>, which is completely awesome so far.  The backend is way better than GoDaddy&#8217;s (none of that ASP-and-glitzy-web-2.0 junk) and as an added benefit they don&#8217;t <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y23xYU_VFZc" target="_blank">rely on sex to sell their products</a> (there&#8217;s much more where that one came from).  It&#8217;s also a completely reasonable price – slightly more than what I was paying before, but totally worth it so far.

Another project I&#8217;m hoping to take on this summer is a total redesign of this site.  I&#8217;m thinking of writing my own WordPress theme from the ground up, which should be a pretty interesting project.
