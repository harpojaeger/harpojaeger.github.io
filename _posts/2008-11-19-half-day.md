We got out of school at noon today, and a rather large crowd went to a diner for lunch. Afterwards, we headed to Salvation Army. It was our intention to then go play laser tag, but the place turned out not to open until 4:00. So we all went our separate ways, my car (actually a friend&#8217;s that I was driving) stopping at Trader Joe&#8217;s to pick up some Gone Bananas chocolate-covered frozen bananas. Which are the best thing in the world. My mother and I have become so addicted to them that they have become known as The Chronic at my house, with tonic water being called Chronic Water, since we&#8217;re rather addicted to that too. It was a great relief to get the bananas, since the last time I went there they had none, as their frozen food warehouse had burned down. Fortunately, they were back in stock now, so my cravings have been satisfied.  
This afternoon I will be taking my ACMT recertification exam online, which probably won&#8217;t take very long. I will also be doing a bunch of homework, and getting to bed early. Hopefully.
