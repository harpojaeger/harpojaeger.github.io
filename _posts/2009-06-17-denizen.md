A lot has happened recently.  I&#8217;ve been involved in some very complicated issues at my school.  It looks as though they are progressing favourably.  I&#8217;ve also gotten a Facebook.  I had been resisting this, but I think it had to happen.  I suppose it will make my life easier and all, but I&#8217;m still skeptical.
