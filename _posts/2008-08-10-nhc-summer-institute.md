Tomorrow I leave for the National Havurah Committee&#8217;s annual Summer Retreat in New Hampshire, a weeklong Jewish extravaganza.  The NHC organizes many such events, but this is the biggest.  Basically, a lot of really awesome people get together for a week and learn, talk, and debate about pretty much everything.  I look forward to this event all year, and I&#8217;ll probably write a few posts over the next week about what&#8217;s happening there.
