It&#8217;s commendable that Israel cares about its soldiers so much that it&#8217;s willing to trade over 1000 prisoners for one of them. I wish that were true of our country – we&#8217;ve stopped noticing the bodies coming home from Afghanistan, much less the injured or captured. But a friend of mine made a good point yesterday: the simple math here implies that soldiers, perhaps by virtue of being uniformed, rather than non-uniformed, combatants, are inherently more valuable. Armies are certainly not the same as terrorists, but at the end of the day, they&#8217;re both trying to kill people. I&#8217;m troubled by the implication that soldiers inherently deserve freedom while combatants do not – especially given most armies&#8217; historical lack of internal accountability.

I&#8217;m not trying to claim that Gilad Shalit is complicit in some unspecified war crime. But if I had a reason to believe he might be, he&#8217;d still be elevated to hero status because of his uniform. Palestinian prisoners aren&#8217;t afforded that privilege. Domestically, yes, but internationally, no. So in a way, this exchange further entrenches the narrative of the peace-loving Israeli and the revenge-driven Palestinian.

I&#8217;m overjoyed that a young man who&#8217;s been held in cruel conditions for an unspeakable amount of time is returned to his family.  I hope that we&#8217;ll come to recognize Palestinians as deserving the same dignity we instinctively afford to Israeli soldiers.
