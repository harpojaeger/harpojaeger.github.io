We got home earlier than expected, at about four or so.  I have been doing some yardwork, and am heading up to see Will at the farm.  I will stay there tonight, and we will catch up on our math and physics work, on which we are extremely behind.  I may also bring the <a href="http://carofawesomeness.com" target="_blank">LC(A)</a> to show off.  Will has told people about it, but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve ever actually seen it in the flesh (plastic?).

Our first Frisbee game is on Thursday.
