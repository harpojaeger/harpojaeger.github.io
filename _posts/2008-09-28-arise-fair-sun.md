Well, I&#8217;m up, and I&#8217;ve been working for a while. I have put together a list of admission deadlines for regular and non-binding early admission. I am in the middle of planning where to apply under which programs. It looks as though I will probably apply to Yale&#8217;s early action program, which is single-choice, meaning that although it is non-binding, I cannot apply early action to anywhere else. That is OK, because only two of my other schools (WPI and UMass Amherst) have non-binding early action anyway.
