I am switching entirely to <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a>. I am in the process of uploading my iCal calendars. Then I may subscribe to them in iCal once they are uploaded, so I can still sync them to my iPod.

I still need to find a good solution for my contacts.
