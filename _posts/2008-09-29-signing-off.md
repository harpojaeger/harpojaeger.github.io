Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, begins tonight, and continues through tomorrow. We will be at synagogue for most of the day tomorrow, although we&#8217;re not going this evening. My iPwn (on which I am writing this post), is the last remaining powered-on electronic device in our household, so I am now going to shut it off. Happy new year!
