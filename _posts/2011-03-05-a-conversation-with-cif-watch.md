When the J Street smear video broke (see <a title="Fisking yet another smear against J Street" href="http://harpojaeger.com/2011/03/04/fisking-yet-another-smear-against-j-street/" target="_blank">my last post</a>), <a href="http://cifwatch.com/" target="_blank">CiF Watch</a> tweeted a link to it, saying I was pro-BDS (<a title="BDS: a threat to peace" href="http://harpojaeger.com/2009/11/21/bds-a-threat-to-peace/" target="_blank">I&#8217;m not</a>).  I replied, and over the next hour or so, we had a conversation about anti-semitism and anti-Zionism.  I committed to writing a post exploring what I believe to be substantive differences between the two.  I think an understanding of those differences is key for Zionists (or anyone who&#8217;s not an anti-Zionist) – crying wolf at false cases of anti-semitism is not only incredibly damaging to those accused, which in and of itself should be enough of a reason not to do it, but ultimately counterproductive in actually identifying real cases of anti-semitism.

I&#8217;m planning to write that post tomorrow or early next week, but here&#8217;s the conversation that<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/cifwatch" target="_blank"> @CiFWatch</a> and I had on Twitter.  CiF Watch deleted their initial tweet claiming I was pro-BDS after I corrected them, so you won&#8217;t see that one here. Also note that the conversation goes on beyond the excerpt here – hit the &#8220;view more&#8221; button at the bottom to see the whole thing.
