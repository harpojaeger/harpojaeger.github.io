Well, <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-spine/77607/martin-peretz-apology#comments" target="_blank">he apologized</a> for saying that Muslims shouldn&#8217;t have First Amendment rights:

> The embarrassing sentence is: &#8220;I wonder whether I need honor these people and pretend they are worthy of the privileges of the First Amendment, which I have in my gut the sense that they will abuse.&#8221; I wrote that, but I do not believe that.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> So I apologize for my sentence, not least because it misrepresents me.

But then he turns right around and says this!

> There is no hatred in my heart; there is deep anxiety about the dangers of Islamism, and anger at the refusal of certain politicians and commentators to adequately grasp those dangers,

I&#8217;ll take him at his word that he doesn&#8217;t hate Muslims, but here you have it; he has &#8220;deep anxiety about the dangers of Islamism.&#8221;  What dangers, exactly, might you be referring to, Mr. Peretz?  And &#8220;Islamism&#8221;?  This term in and of itself is highly Islamophobic.  No one uses &#8220;Christianism&#8221; to describe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_George_Tiller#Trial_of_Scott_Roeder" target="_blank">Scott Roeder</a>&#8216;s philosophy.  We don&#8217;t say &#8220;Jewishism&#8221; to describe <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/mosque-vandalized-as-settlers-attack-palestinian-village-1.284247" target="_blank">Israeli settler violence</a>.  No, we call it what it is: violent extremism.  &#8220;Islamism&#8221; implies some sort of creeping danger from Muslims, or from Islam in general.

I give Peretz credit for believing that Muslims are worth of constitutional protections, but that&#8217;s a pretty low bar.  He&#8217;s got a long way to go.
