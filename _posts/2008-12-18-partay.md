I just got back from my school&#8217;s faculty holiday party.  Since my dad works at the school, I was invited.  I had an excellent time.  One rather intriguing thing that happened was that I discovered a Hershey&#8217;s Special Dark chocolate bar that was packaged upside down.  Chocolate bars are in the shape of a trapezoidal prism, and usually the longer side of the trapezoid is the one on the side of the wrapper with the seam that you peel to open.  The shorter side, with the ingots and respective logos stamped into it, is on top, where the brand is printed on the wrapper.  However, this one was backwards.  It was very confusing, and I have saved the chocolate for posterity, and further consultation with the requisite authorities.  My statistics teacher and I discussed the implications this has for quality control, but given our low sample size (there were no other chocolates of the same variety [thus n=1]), we could not draw any statistically significant conclusions.

So it goes.
