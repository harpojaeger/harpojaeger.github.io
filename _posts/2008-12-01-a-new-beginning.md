It was great to be back in school today. Although the day was long (as normal), I had time to relax with friends, and I got a lot done in classes and organization-wise.  
During the last block of the day, which I have free, I played some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UYg-cCNjU" target="_blank">serious foursquare</a>, and had the interview for 5-Alone, which was very fun.  
I am going to go to sleep early tonight; I was up late last night and need some sleep.
