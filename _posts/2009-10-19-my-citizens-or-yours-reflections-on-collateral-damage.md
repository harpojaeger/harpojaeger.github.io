The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/UNFFMGC_Report.pdf" target="_blank">Goldstone report</a> has generated quite a splash, to say the least, in a lot of different arenas.  Between Israel condemning it, and the most recent developments within the UN, it&#8217;s an ongoing issue.  And it&#8217;s made me think about another important issue &#8211; the idea of collateral damage.

So when you&#8217;re facing an enemy like Hamas who has no problem using civilians as shields, you&#8217;re faced with a difficult moral decision.

Oh wait.  That&#8217;s right.  You&#8217;re not actually.  At all.

If your enemy is using a civilian as a human shield, you don&#8217;t shoot.  Period.

I recognize a nation&#8217;s right to sovereignty.  A nation&#8217;s right to defend its own citizens.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s ideal, but I recognize that for the moment, in this world, the most efficient and fair way of organizing things is by separate nations with often-competing interests.

But being a member or leader of a nation doesn&#8217;t mean that other citizens are second class.  You don&#8217;t get to kill other civilians in defense of your own.  No matter how you dodge, you&#8217;re stating that you value your own citizens more highly as humans than others&#8217;.  And that&#8217;s fundamentally wrong and inhumane.

And the same is true of those using their own citizens or fellow countrymen as shields.  It&#8217;s inhumane, disrespectful, and ultimately counterproductive.

I will, without reservation, continue to condemn anyone who endangers civilians, whether they&#8217;re on the defense or the offense.  It&#8217;s simply inexcusable.
