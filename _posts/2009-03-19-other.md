The other semifinals trial on Monday will be between Sharon High School and Westford Academy. This one&#8217;s in Boston, at John Joseph Moakley Courthouse, which is a fabulous place. It looks out over the harbor, and that wall is made of entirely of large rectangular panes of glass, giving it an astounding view.

Our trial is at Worcester Superior Courthouse, which is also a pretty great building, although it doesn&#8217;t have a view.

We have no school tomorrow, but the Mock Trial team is meeting.
