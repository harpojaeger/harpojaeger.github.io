My school always makes the Friday before Columbus Day a curriculum planning day so that we have a four-day weekend. In my case it is actually a five-day weekend since I took yesterday off as well, and I am taking this opportunity to go with a few other friends to our old middle school in Haydenville. We&#8217;ll be there for the all-school assembly that happens on Friday mornings, and today my youngest sister will be getting up because her birthday is on Sunday, so we will be there for that. I am also going to meet my sister&#8217;s teacher who is new this year.
