Driving to Truro for the weekend, I am struck by how strange the names of towns in MA are. I just passed a sign for Mashpee and Sandwich. Whether Mashpee is a food or an action I cannot say.  
Other strange names of towns in MA:  
•Belchertown  
•Athol  
•Braintree  
•Alewife  
I think I will keep a running list of such strange names. Expect more posts on this in the future.
