I have upgraded this site to WordPress 2.7. This is a big deal. Although the site doesn&#8217;t really look that different (read: at all), the administrator backend is much easier to use, and has a bunch of really great new features. It was a rather complicated upgrade, though, because I was not just upgrading a single WordPress 2.6.x install. Rather, I had been running WordPress MU, the multi-user version of WordPress. So I had to manually back up and reimport my data to the site, which took quite a while. I am no longer using MU, since it hasn&#8217;t been updated to 2.7 yet, and since I am no longer hosting the <a href="http://carofawesomeness.com/plog" target="_blank">LC(A) Plog</a> here anymore. MU was just getting too complicated to administer, as it has special needs. A lot of plugins and modifications built for WordPress don&#8217;t work with MU, and my site is a lot simpler to run now.
