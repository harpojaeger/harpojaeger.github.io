We had a ton of people over at my house for the break fast this evening. There was much wine, food, and revelry. The fast today was relatively easy. Last year and the year before I recall being rather crabby, but I wasn&#8217;t today. I had a bit of a headache in the early afternoon when we returned from synagogue, but it didn&#8217;t last. I lay around, cleaned my room, did a lot of laundry and dishes, and wrote the sonnet of the week. All in all, a most fulfilling and relaxing day.
