I am on my way back to school. Hooray! After an excellent night&#8217;s sleep, I am feeling a whole lot better. I think sleep as a recovery method is underrated; it works very well.  
Today I have an hour and a half long study first thing and an hour and forty five minute study last. My plan is to fill out all of my teacher and guidance recommendation firms, and get as much done on my actual application as possible. All hail the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Application" target="_blank">Common App</a>!
