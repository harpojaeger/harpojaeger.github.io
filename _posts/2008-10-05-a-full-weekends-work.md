Last night I went to the potluck at the Food Bank Farm in Hadley, which was a lot of fun. One of the highlights of the night was when all of the teenagers danced to &#8220;The Bear Missed the Train&#8221;, as played by the most excellent children&#8217;s entertainer <a href="http://rogertincknell.com" target="_blank">Roger Tincknell</a>. We also had a rousing game of Capture the Flag. Simon and Will both stayed over at my house last night, and Will and I did various types of work (calculus, physics, Lego) today after Simon left early in the morning (before we arose).  
I am leaving tomorrow morning at about 8:00 to visit a friend at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I&#8217;ll be staying over and coming back Tuesday afternoon in time for my social dance class at school at 2:30. This looks to be a very interesting visit. The friend I&#8217;m staying with trains at my kung-fu school when he&#8217;s not in Worcester, and he&#8217;s started a little mini-school at WPI, training students and testing them. He&#8217;s asked me to lead a class tomorrow night, which I think will be a lot of fun. I am somewhat out of shape because I haven&#8217;t been at kung-fu in a while due to my ongoing pertussis, but I am looking forward to the class.
