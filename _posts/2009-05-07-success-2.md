Calvinball was AMAZING!  There must have been forty people there.  We spent the whole lunch running around, sometimes in a huge group, sometimes in a couple, sometimes with stragglers.  We had people in every grade, and some teachers as well.  We went inside, outside, all over the place.

People took lots of pictures, which will apparently be in the yearbook, or maybe next years&#8217;.  The school&#8217;s executive director (the principal in normal public school terms) said that this was one of the most notable events in the HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL!

IT WAS AWESOME!

We are going to try to do it at least once more before the end of the year.
