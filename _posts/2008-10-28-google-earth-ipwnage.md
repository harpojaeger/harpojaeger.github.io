Yesterday I downloaded the newly released Google Earth for iPwn. It  
Is awesome. Although its tracking algorithm doesn&#8217;t seem to work quite as well as the built-in Maps app, it has some additional features that are really nifty. You can rotate and tilt the display, viewing from any orientation in three dimensions. Google Earth has 3-d terrain data, so you can tilt the iPwn up and down to view mountains and such in all their glory.
