I am on my way to school, having just finished a battery of Pulmonary Function Tests at the hospital. I was supposed to be done by 8:30, but I beat the receptionist there (I arrived at 7:06 for a 7:15 appointment), and the Respiratory Therapist who was doing my tests had some computer trouble, so we had to wait for another CRT to come down and fix it.  
For all of the tests, I sat in a chair in a glass case and breathed into a valve while wearing a nose clips. For some of them, I had to squeeze my cheeks with my hands to prevent them from holding any air. Most of the time, the door of the case was open, and I was just using the equipment inside, but for one test, the door was sealed and it took all sorts of temperature readings and such.  
I managed to make it out of the lab with the nose clip, which I am sure I can find some sort of interesting use for.
