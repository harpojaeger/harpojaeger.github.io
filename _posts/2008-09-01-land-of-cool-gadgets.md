I actually kind of enjoy being at the hospital because of all the cool technology. There is a very nifty device that they use to draw blood that allows them to take multiple samples in different tubes with only one needle. It has some kind of auto-shutoff valve that allows blood through only when a tube is attached to the needle. I also just had an x-ray, and the x-ray machines are AWESOME. All sorts of exciting tubes and lights. Very sci-fi.
