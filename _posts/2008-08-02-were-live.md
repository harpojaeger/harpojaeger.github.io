The transition to WordPress Mu is now complete.  Finally, I can edit my website without having to be at my home computer.  I&#8217;m still fine-tuning some things, so expect some strange things to happen every so often.  Also, I haven&#8217;t yet put up the galleries for the Lego Car of Awesomeness yet.  They should be up soon, along with the entries from the old blog and Plog.

Using the WordPress client for the iPhone, I am now able to blog from anywhere.  This means that the blog page will get a lot more interesting very soon.
