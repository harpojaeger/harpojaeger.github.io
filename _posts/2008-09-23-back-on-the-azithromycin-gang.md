I went to the doctor earlier today, and I&#8217;m back on azithromycin. I&#8217;ve taken the first day&#8217;s two-pill medication, and now have four days of one pill each. Although I haven&#8217;t been contagious since I took it the first time, the hope is that this second round will help to knock out the symptoms, which are proving quite tenacious.
