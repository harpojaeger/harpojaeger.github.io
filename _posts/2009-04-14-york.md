Tomorrow I am heading to Carnegie Hall to see the YouTube Symphony Orchestra.  It is a half-day at school, and since I normally have no classes in the morning on Wednesday, I am not going in to school at all.  Will will be picking me up at home, we will grab another friend a couple blocks away, and then head to New Haven.  From there, we will take the train into the city.

The show is at seven-thirty, so we are going to be back pretty late.
