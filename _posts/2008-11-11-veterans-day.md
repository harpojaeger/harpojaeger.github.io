Joe Biden said something in the vice-presidential debate that I though was very interesting and it wasn&#8217;t a political attack or a policy statement. Here is the excerpt:

> I have never since that moment in my first year questioned the motive of another member of the Congress or Senate with whom I&#8217;ve disagreed. I&#8217;ve questioned their judgment.

On this day above all others, what he said rings true to me. I think that the thing that&#8217;s taken the hardest beating and that&#8217;s been the most excommunicated from Washington politics is the respect for other peoples&#8217; motives. Certainly that is no more important today than any other day, but it is certainly more poignant. We all can and should have a uniform respect for our veterans&#8217; and soldiers&#8217; service, regardless of our party affiliations and political views.  
I think this is historically the essence of American patriotism; the idea that differing opinions are not the same as conflicting motives. Now, more than ever, I am proud to be an American.
