Tonight I am going to Northampton&#8217;s First Night celebration.  My friends from the NHC Summer Institute are all here in full force for our annual Recodion.  At the moment we are hanging out, and we will be heading downtown soon; I am performing at 3:00 and need to be there at 2:00.  It is snowing like crazy.  Six to ten inches by the end of the night.  It is going to be an excellent New Year&#8217;s.
