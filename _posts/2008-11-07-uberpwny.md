We just observed a miniature pony in someone&#8217;s backyard on the way to school. We discussed the possibility of getting one. My sister wanted to trade our chickens for one (it is no secret that she rather dislikes them), but my father and I wanted to just get one. Or a goat. Except that a goat would just eat our yard, and house, probably.
