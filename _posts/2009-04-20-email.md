I set up my Brown email address! It redirects to my Gmail account, and I can send mail as it from there. This is awesome.

Tomorrow I am going to be at Brown for the day at a program for admitted students. I will get to meet people, see cool presentations, and such. I am also planning to spend a bunch of time in Providence and just generally browsing the campus to get a feel for it. This will be the first time I have visited since I was admitted, and I am looking forward to it.

Sleep is now my highest priority.
