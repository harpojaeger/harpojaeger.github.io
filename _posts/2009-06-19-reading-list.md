I have four books that I need to read right now, five if I count one for Brown (summer work!).  One is not in the library yet &#8211; Seeds of Terror, which is about the connection between Al Qaeda and the Afghan opium poppy trade.  I saw the author being interviewed on The Daily Show, and she was one of the smartest people I had ever seen.  So I reserved the book right then, and am waiting to read it.  I have with me The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma, which I&#8217;ve been meaning to read for a while and I think will start tonight, The Cluetrain Manifesto, which is about the way the Internet is changing business, and a book by the Motley Fool about direct investing.  I think I will write reviews of each after I finish.
