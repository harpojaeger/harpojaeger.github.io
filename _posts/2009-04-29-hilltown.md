Tonight I am heading to the Annual Meeting of the <a href="http://hilltowncharter.org/" target="_blank">Hilltown Cooperative Charter Public School</a>, where I attended from fifth through eighth grade.  Some members of my class (the class of 2006) have been asked to come talk about our experiences there, as we are all heading off to college and such places next year.  I am looking forward to seeing a lot of people who I haven&#8217;t seen in a while, students and faculty.  The part where we talk is not till about 7:20, but I am going for the whole thing beginning at 6:30.  I have never been to one of these before, and I&#8217;m curious to see what goes on.
