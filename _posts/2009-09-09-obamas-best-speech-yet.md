Tonight&#8217;s health care speech was solidly the best speech I&#8217;ve ever seen Obama deliver.  He backed the public option.  He called out the liars.  He put forward a plan.  And he did it without sacrificing bipartisianship.  He conceded tort reform, supported an individual mandate, and mentioned the people who&#8217;ve worked with Kennedy across the aisle.

The speech had exactly the right mix of stubbornness with regard to morals and understanding of GOP positions.  But he also wasn&#8217;t afraid to condemn those who don&#8217;t have any interest in reform.  People who have legitimate concerns will be heard, now, as ever.  People who don&#8217;t won&#8217;t be invited to negotiate.

To the supporters: Keep your minds open and your morals strong.

To the opposers: Bring us your concerns and we&#8217;ll work through them together.

To the naysayers: Your time is over.  Get out.

This is the bottom line.  Reform now.
