Is that a word?  If it isn&#8217;t, it should be.

Anyway, we might have a snow day tomorrow.  I have elected not to watch Murder by Death with the rest of my family and instead do my homework to prepare for potential school.  That way, if we do not have a snow day, I can sleep late and not feel guilty.

I went to a Mock Trial meeting after work today.  It was quite productive.  We had a trial on Friday (which we won), and are now preparing for a tiebreaker trial to determine the winner of our region (against Tantasqua, a team we have not played before, but who are also 3-0 at this point) on Wednesday.  We have a lot to do to be ready.  I am confident in our ability to do so, but it will require some really hard work.
