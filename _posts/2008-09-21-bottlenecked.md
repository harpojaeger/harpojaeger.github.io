We have just been informed by the conductor that we&#8217;ll be stopped in North Haven for a few minutes. Apparently there&#8217;s only one track further ahead, and, as the conductor put it, &#8220;the other guy got there first&#8221;. I am glad, at least, that the two engineers didn&#8217;t try to play chicken.
