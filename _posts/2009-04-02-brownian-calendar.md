<a href="http://www.google.com/calendar" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a> is becoming really awesome.  I just spent about forty-five minutes entering various data about Brown stuff, and it is going to be really useful.  I have a calendar shared with my parents, and have entered all filing deadlines, special events, etc.  Also, the discussion feature has thus far allowed me to take some notes on what I&#8217;m doing (like filling out paper forms and getting things to my college counselor), and as my parents start to reference the calendar more, we will all be able to keep track of our progress there.
