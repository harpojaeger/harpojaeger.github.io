I forgot something in the last post.  I am also planning to get a credit card on my eighteenth birthday.

Jumptown offers a video and still photos of your jump for an extra $115.  That is a lot of money.  But they also have edited the footage, and put it to music, which is sort of silly.  I watched a few demo videos, and they&#8217;re sort of cheesy.  Perhaps I can get them to just give me the raw footage, which I would much prefer, and maybe take the price down a bit.
