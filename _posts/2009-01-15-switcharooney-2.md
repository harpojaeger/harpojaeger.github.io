I&#8217;ve been switched to another flight because of delays in my layover. We&#8217;re about to depart.  
I had the smoothest and quickest security check ever. There was a nifty machine that you step into that cuffs you with air, I suppose so they can see if you are carrying anything. It was very sci-fi; you enter, and it says &#8220;Air cuff on&#8221;, and blows air on you, and says &#8220;Wait for green light&#8221;. Then you wait, and a green light comes, and a door slides open, and you walk through the metal detector.  
They did take a rather long time looking at my bag in the x-ray machine. I am not sure why; there was nothing terribly interesting in it.  
So it goes.
