I was pretty sick last night, and didn&#8217;t get much sleep, so I&#8217;m taking today off from school. I&#8217;m going to the doctor&#8217;s later, and I will spend most of the day working on college stuff. It is good to have a break from my routine. I did have some important stuff to get done today, but I think I will be able to catch up on it tomorrow. I have also told all of my teachers that I am expecting to be pretty behind until I finish college stuff, and that I will buckle down after that&#8217;s all done to get back on track with my normal schoolwork.
