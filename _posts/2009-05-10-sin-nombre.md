We got fifth place at the Greenfield tournament yesterday.  It was an awesome day.  Very tiring, but very fun.

I just got back from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1127715/" target="_blank">Sin Nombre</a> at <a href="http://amherstcinema.org/" target="_blank">Amherst Cinema</a>.  It was really good, but extremely scary.  I would not recommend it to anyone who can&#8217;t stomach violence.  That said, I didn&#8217;t find the violence to be gratuitous.  I dislike movies where the violence is for no purpose other than to sell, and I didn&#8217;t feel that way at all about this one.  It was a scary story, and one that needed to be told in the way it was.  I think I will write a longer review of it soon when I have more time.  Tonight I need to finish a paper for school tomorrow.

Also, I now am the owner of a megaphone.  Very useful.
