The <a href="http://hilltowncharter.org" target="_blank">HCCPS</a> annual meeting was a great success.  I ended up going with some friends separately from my mom.  Afterwards, we went and got some ice cream (I had a root beer float) at <a href="http://www.herrells.com/design/?int=1" target="_blank">Herrell&#8217;s</a>.  It was great to see everyone again, and I really liked being at the meeting.  We talked a bit about ourselves, and our experiences at Hilltown, and then people asked us some questions.  Overall, a wonderful evening.

I have a bunch of homework to finish up, and then I am off to catch up on some much-needed sleep.
