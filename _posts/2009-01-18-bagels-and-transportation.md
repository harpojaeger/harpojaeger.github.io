We have obtained a great quantity of bagels at Brooklyn Bagel

I also learned from our host some very interesting information about the history of public transportation in LA. Apparently there was a regional trolley network that went from downtown LA all the way out to places like Silver Lake where we are now. In 1948, GM created a fake company for the purpose of buying the rail system from the government, and shut the whole thing down within two weeks, citing the supposed need for a bus system that would move where the people did. This is clearly nonsense; historically, infrastructure such as transportation has dictated were population centers arise, not the other way around. If you create a reliable and efficient means of getting from place to place, people will use it.  
But the historical precedent set by GM has apparently endured to this day; LA&#8217;s public transportation is primarily provided by buses, and there are still arguments about increasing its reach with revenue from tolls, meeting with heavy opposition.

Now the crazy guy who paints the house numbers on the curb in from of houses is here, giving his theories in eveything from synagogues to Jesse Jackson. What an excellent morning.
