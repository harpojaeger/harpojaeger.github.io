We are on our way to Brandeis. Just a minute ago I asked my iPwn for directions from I-90E (where we are) to Brandeis, to determine which exit to use, and was surprised to find the total distance given as 517 miles. It turns out that the Maps application calculated the driving directions from the *beginning* of I-90E, which is in Erie, PA.
