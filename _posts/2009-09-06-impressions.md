I&#8217;ve been at Brown now since yesterday morning.  I&#8217;ve met SO many interesting people, and there are so many more to meet.  One of the biggest transitions has definitely been class size.  <a href="http://pvpa.org" target="_blank">PVPA</a>, all six grades, is less than a quarter the size of just the incoming freshman class here.  It&#8217;s SO BIG!  I&#8217;m coming to terms with the fact that I will not know everyone.  But I am making some good friends.

People are really friendly.  Especially when you remember that they&#8217;re all in the same boat as you; they&#8217;re nervous about meeting people as well.  If I suspend my judgment long enough to meet someone, I usually find them to be interesting and really engaging.  So it&#8217;s been a really rewarding experience so far.

Orientation programming continues essentially through Tuesday, when our first academic meetings with advisors occur.  I also have two job interviews on Tuesday and another on Thursday, all for on-campus jobs.  They are all really interesting positions, so I will be figuring that out pretty soon.

Things are coming together.  There&#8217;s certainly a lot to keep track of, but I feel pretty on top of it, especially with the help of the advisors and orientation committee, who&#8217;ve been awesome.

So far, a big thumbs up.  College is pretty fun.
