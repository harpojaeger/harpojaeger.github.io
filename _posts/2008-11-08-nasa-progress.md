I think my proposal will be directed to the NASA Ames Research Center, as they handle the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and solar system exploration. The proposal has to be delivered via snail mail, so it will take me some time to draft a letter to send them. It also has to include detailed cost data and the like. I think I will do some research on the space shuttle and how cargo is stored and deployed so my letter at least appears well thought-out, even if it is a complete practical joke.  
I am very excited to see what NASA does in response. As far as I can tell, I am not doing anything illegal, but they probably won&#8217;t be very happy.
