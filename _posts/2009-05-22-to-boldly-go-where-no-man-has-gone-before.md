I saw Star Trek last night.  To cut straight to the chase, I loved.  It was completely clear how much the writers and director loved the original stuff.  I think people complain about remake movies of this kind way too much.  They often don&#8217;t accept that people appreciate different things than they do, and make a different movie than they would.  That being said, I didn&#8217;t think it was perfect.  Parts of the plot didn&#8217;t seem to make sense to me, and some of the acting was a bit overdone.  But I did not get the feeling that the movie was created with the sole purpose of extending the franchise.  It stands on its own, and is a good piece of film even ignoring its predecessors.

Also, I really want to buy <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/tools/BCED/" target="_blank">this</a> and one of <a href="http://www.voltaicsystems.com/" target="_blank">these</a> (for when I get my laptop).

Tonight is my school&#8217;s prom.  I am wearing tails.
