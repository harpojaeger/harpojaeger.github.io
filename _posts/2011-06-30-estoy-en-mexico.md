For the next month, this blog is going to focus primarily, if not exclusively, on my travels in Mexico.  I flew into Mexico City today, and will remain here until Friday morning, when I&#8217;ll be taking a bus down to Oaxaca.  I&#8217;ll be studying Spanish there at the <a href="http://icomexico.com" target="_blank">Instituto Cultural</a> for the month of July.  
It&#8217;s been a whirlwind afternoon &#8211; Mexico City is huge and confusing, especially since my Spanish is pretty abysmal at this point.  I&#8217;ve seen some pretty desperate poverty so far, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen enough of the city to have a good grasp of it as a whole.  The neighborhood I&#8217;m in also seems to have some fairly affluent folks as well.  
This should be a very interesting month.  Stay tuned&#8230;
