I have finished my final standardized test. I will NEVER take the SAT or ACT again.  
I have a bunch of homework to do this afternoon before heading up to Will&#8217;s for the rest of the weekend. I am excited to have some time off from my normal, hectic, college-laden life.  
In completely random news, WordPress 2.7 is now available. WordPress is a popular blog and Content Management System; I use it for this site. The new version is still in beta, and there doesn&#8217;t appear to be a MU (multi-user) version yet. Since I use MU on this site, I am probably going to have to wait about another month, when the development team predicts it will be out of beta, but I&#8217;m very excited.  
This season&#8217;s Mock Trial case comes out on Monday, which means that our school&#8217;s team (of which I am a member) is getting ready to kick into gear. We have a lot of work to do, and I am very glad I have college stuff out of the way before this all starts.
