I pulled an all-nighter last night, and I&#8217;m still not done with my homework. I am about to get started.  
I also recently discovered a fabulous new webcomic, <a href="http://questionablecontent.net/" target="_blank">Questionable Content</a>. The character development is amazing, the artwork is wonderful, and it takes place in the town where I live.
