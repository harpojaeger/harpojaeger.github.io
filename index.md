I live in Brooklyn, NY. I write a lot of code, which you can see on [GitHub](https://github.com/harpojaeger). I've worked on or managed political campaigns in Arizona, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Colorado and Washington, DC.

Talk to me on Twitter (modern) at [@harpojaeger](http://twitter.com/harpojaeger) or on the air (more fun) at [KR7MJ](http://www.qrz.com/db/KR7MJ). Take a look at [APRS.fi](http://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=14&call=a%2FKR7MJ-7&timerange=3600&tail=3600) to see some places I've been recently.

Here's [my PGP public key](/pgp.txt).
