I live with my partner Chlo√© in Tucson, AZ, where I'm a community organizer and stagehand.  Our yard is home to a lot of cacti, and our house an undisclosed number of carpentry projects in various stages of completion/abandonment, along with antiquated technology, klezmer music and sea chanteys.

I serve as Treasurer of the Board for the [National Havurah Committee](http://havurah.org).  Previously, I wrote and edited at [Jewschool](http://jewschool.com) and [New Voices Magazine](http:///newvoicesmag.org).  Aside from all that, my main claim to fame is that [Marshall Ganz](http://marshallganz.com/) likes my name and we ate grapes together.  I think that's pretty cool.

I majored in Education History & Policy at Brown University and also did a self-designed study in Politics & Community Organizing.  While in school, I co-founded a [J Street U](http://jstreetu.org) chapter and an anti-sexual violence task force.  I've worked on campaigns in Tucson, Providence, Western Massachusetts, Boston, Denver and Washington, DC.
