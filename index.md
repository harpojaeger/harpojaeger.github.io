I live in Tucson, AZ. I've worked on or managed political campaigns in Arizona, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Colorado and Washington, DC. I also write code, much of which you can see on [my GitHub](https://github.com/harpojaeger).

Talk to me on Twitter (modern) at [@harpojaeger](http://twitter.com/harpojaeger) or on the air (more fun) at [KR7MJ](http://www.qrz.com/db/KR7MJ). I'm a member of [RST](http://rstclub.com/) and the [K7UAZ ARC](http://k7uaz.com). Take a look at [APRS.fi](http://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=14&call=a%2FKR7MJ-7&timerange=3600&tail=3600) to see some places I've been recently, or find me at the [TFTM](http://tftm.org/) Saturday contra dances.
