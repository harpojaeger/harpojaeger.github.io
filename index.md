I live with my partner Chlo√© in Tucson, AZ, where I'm a community organizer and stagehand.  Our yard is home to a lot of cacti, and our house an undisclosed number of carpentry projects in various stages of completion/abandonment, along with antiquated technology, klezmer music and sea chanteys.

I've worked on or managed campaigns in Arizona, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Colorado and Washington, DC.
