I majored in Education History & Policy at Brown University and did a self-designed study in Politics & Community Organizing.  While at Brown, I co-founded a [J Street U](http://jstreetu.org) chapter and an anti-sexual violence task force.  I've worked on campaigns in Providence, Western Massachusetts, Boston, Denver and Washington, DC.

I've written for and was previously on the editorial boards at [Jewschool](http://jewschool.com) and [New Voices Magazine](http:///newvoicesmag.org).  Aside from that, my main claim to fame is that [Marshall Ganz](http://marshallganz.com/) likes my name and we ate grapes together, and a friend once wrote an [article](http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/98657/an-outsider-in-the-woods) about Jews in the Woods that referred to me as a "tie-dye clad student organizer."  I think that's pretty cool.
