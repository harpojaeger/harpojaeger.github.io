<meta name="description" content="I saw Star Trek last night. To cut straight to the chase, I loved. It was completely clear how much the writers and director loved the original stuff. I think people complain about remake movies of this kind way too much. They often don’t accept that people appreciate different things than they do, and make a different movie than they would. That being said, I didn’t think it was perfect. Parts of the plot didn’t seem to make sense to me, and some of the acting was a bit overdone. But I did not get the feeling that the movie was created with the sole purpose of extending the franchise. It stands on its own, and is a good piece of film even ignoring its predecessors." />

  <p>I saw Star Trek last night. To cut straight to the chase, I loved. It was completely clear how much the writers and director loved the original stuff. I think people complain about remake movies of this kind way too much. They often don’t accept that people appreciate different things than they do, and make a different movie than they would. That being said, I didn’t think it was perfect. Parts of the plot didn’t seem to make sense to me, and some of the acting was a bit overdone. But I did not get the feeling that the movie was created with the sole purpose of extending the franchise. It stands on its own, and is a good piece of film even ignoring its predecessors.</p>

<p>Also, I really want to buy <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/tools/BCED/" target="_blank">this</a> and one of <a href="http://www.voltaicsystems.com/" target="_blank">these</a> (for when I get my laptop).</p>

<p>Tonight is my school’s prom. I am wearing tails.</p>
