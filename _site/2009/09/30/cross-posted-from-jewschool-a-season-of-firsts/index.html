  <h1 class="post-title">Cross-posted from Jewschool: A season of firsts</h1>
  <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2009</span>
  <p>This high holiday season was new for me in many ways. It was my first away from my family, it was the first time I fasted without drinking water, and it was also the first time I didn&#8217;t go to services during the day on Yom Kippur. This last one, and a related concept I&#8217;ve been thinking about a lot recently, are what I want to talk about here. As anyone who&#8217;s done it knows, praying is not a simple concept. It&#8217;s a big category within the religion (as in it encompasses a lot of practices and ideas), and there are a myriad of opinions about every single aspect of it. When, how, where, and why you should do it, and so on. Like many Jews, I&#8217;ve always had a complicated relationship to prayer. I was raised religious, but without much connection to a synagogue. Although very nice, the shul in our town never excited us that much (I think I&#8217;ve talked about my struggles with this a bit in a <a href="http://jewschool.com/2009/09/06/17693/to-date-or-not-to-date/" target="_blank">previous post</a>), and I&#8217;ve looked for other options for a long time.&lt;!--more--&gt; This was bound to complicate my relationship with prayer. Even since starting to wear tzitzit three years ago, I&#8217;ve never prayed regularly, and I&#8217;ve never in my life wrapped tefilin. A lot of this has to do with my historical connection to praying – it&#8217;s never been associated with an excitement to be Jewish for me, so I&#8217;ve never felt too enthusiastic about it. Say what you will about willpower, but it&#8217;s hard to shake those things.</p>

<div style="float:right;">
  <img src="http://api.ning.com/files/dPyjahyognTP6rMOgj1-05Qngjdq6n5G3t7SQnFdZi*Jb7dWgsuFB8SeY4jdcxQ6GeCssg43uqE6oHybAr*94fo85to5ra*w/RosietheTefillinWearerbiggermaybe.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="257" title="This is barely relevant, but I really felt like it needed to be seen."/>
</div>

<p>That being said, do I want to try? If something doesn&#8217;t have a lot of meaning to me, how do I make the decision as to whether or not to pursue it with the intention of giving it more meaning? In my life thus far, I&#8217;ve never felt the need to pursue regular prayer as a component of my spiritual life, and I&#8217;ve never felt a weaker spirituality for it. So it&#8217;s clearly not a uniformly bad thing.</p>

<p>Anyway, on the High Holidays, this issue is especially pressing, because the liturgy is so intense. To be honest, I&#8217;m really not that into a lot of the language from Yom Kippur. This is not at all to insult those who do appreciate it, but it&#8217;s just never really fully synced up with my religious philosophy. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m clay in a potter&#8217;s hands. I don&#8217;t think I need to give myself up to become a better person. I think that everything I need in order to change for the better is already within me.</p>

<p>So although I went to services on Erev Yom Kippur, I didn&#8217;t go back the next day. I slept in a bit, I went to a really excellent class with the rabbi, and I hung around and listened to good music and thought. It was a really good day, and as I mentioned before, the first time I had fasted without drinking. That part was made more difficult by the fact that I hadn&#8217;t decided not to drink until late the night before, so I hadn&#8217;t drunk a lot beforehand and was pretty thirsty. I made it, though, and was glad I did.</p>

<p>After all this, I&#8217;ve definitely figured out more about how I feel about this type of liturgy. Most of my problems with it tend to stem from incompatibilities – as a believer in free will, I have a hard time coming to terms with the idea that there are things humans can&#8217;t do. I believe in an almost unlimited potential for humans to effect self-change. It&#8217;s not easy at all in a lot of cases, and I guess that&#8217;s where a lot of people find solace or relief in G()d. So I have a lot of respect for that.</p>

<p>Problems with Yom Kippur-specific prayers aside, in the past few weeks, due I suppose to the High Holidays and their associated increased-shul-time, I&#8217;ve had some interesting thoughts about the Amidah. At least one of them was brought on by the use of Xeroxed pages of the Artscroll siddur for a Havurah minyan on Erev Yom Kippur (a weird combination). During the Amidah, there are instructions in Artscroll that say things like &#8220;Recite this paragraph while focusing intently on G&amp;d&#8217;s sovereignty&#8221;. This is, in my opinion, sort of weird. I mean, how can you make a statement like that and expect it to apply to everyone? Before this week I would have said that the answer was that it didn&#8217;t have to because the Artscroll is a siddur associated with Orthodox Judaism – not everyone&#8217;s using it. But now that I&#8217;ve used it in a Havurah service, I&#8217;m not so sure. This experience makes me think about what role a siddur should have in our prayer. Should it be nothing more than a script in Hebrew, English, and often with transliteration? Should it also contain instructions on how one is to approach the prayers? Most do, certainly. Where&#8217;s the balance?<img class="alignright" src="http://www.bargainjudaica.com/uploads/images_products/3545.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="243" /></p>

<p>This particular experience is part of a larger shifting of focus I&#8217;ve been undergoing about the Amidah. A little background on my experience with this prayer is useful here: I went to Schechter school up until halfway through third grade, at which point I dropped out and went to Hebrew school until seventh grade, whereupon I dropped out of that also, and had my Bar Mitzvah independent of the shul. I learned the Amidah in day school, and then revisited it in a learning sense while preparing for my Bar Mitzvah. The first time, I only learned the parts that are chanted out loud. I never knew anything about the rest of it. We would just be taught something like &#8220;You sing this bit, then you wait, and then you sing this bit.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t have a full concept of the prayer as a whole. This was also the case in my pre-Bar-Mitzvah studies, due only to a shortage of preparation, if nothing else (my tutor was superb).</p>

<p>Given this, davening the Amidah is always an interesting experience for me. I do the first part with a lot of feeling, always adding in the matriarchs as I was taught in Schechter school (I don&#8217;t want it to sound like it was a monotonous and completely non-insightful teaching philosophy), but once I pass the Kedusha, I&#8217;m in a weird position. I can sound out Hebrew, but I certainly don&#8217;t know enough of it to be able to understand what I&#8217;m reading, so I often read through the English text of the prayers. This is nice, because I feel connected to the meaning of the prayers. Except for the places where I don&#8217;t like the meaning of the prayers. Too often I find myself reciting things I really don&#8217;t agree with. In some other parts of services, like a Prayer for our Country, and a Prayer for Israel, I just don&#8217;t recite along. I try to be unobtrusive to avoid stepping on other people&#8217;s enjoyment of those texts, but I really don&#8217;t feel comfortable asking for divine involvement in government. But in the Amidah, I&#8217;m doing it silently. There&#8217;s no reason for me to say anything I don&#8217;t really believe. So after the Kedusha, I&#8217;ve started standing silently, usually still shuckling because it feels natural (weird how that happens), but meditating on very different concepts than what&#8217;s on the page of the siddur that I now hold closed in my hands, against my chest, on my forehead, or open, obscuring my face. I think about politics, about human rights issues. And usually I end up going back to the three-way bow at the end with &#8220;oseh shalom bimromav&#8221;. Sometimes I even go back and do the actual motion of bowing many many times, almost subconsciously, between my thoughts. To me, this is the most meaningful part of the prayer. We&#8217;ve just spent all of this time glorifying and praising G%d&#8217;s name, and now, as a final request, in a final bow, we ask for G@d to use that power for peace. That seems pretty powerful to me, and, based on my complicated experience with the prayer, the most worthy of repeating.</p>

<p>I continue to be challenged by many aspects of the Jewish liturgy. My hope is that I&#8217;m able to continue finding ways to make these texts to relevant to me. I also hope that I know when I shouldn&#8217;t try. That I don&#8217;t feel tied down to those prayers, bound by their sentiments, withheld by their rituals.</p>

<p>Judaism retains relevance to me because of my ability to make it relevant. In this new year, I resolve to continue that quest.</p>

<p>Shana tova.</p>
