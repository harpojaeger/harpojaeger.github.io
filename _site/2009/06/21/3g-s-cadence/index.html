<meta name="description" content="The saga of my purchasing of the new iPhone 3G S began yesterday, when my mom asked why I hadn’t camped out for the new iPhone. I explained to her the upgrade eligibility requirements, which resulted in my being unable to buy an iPhone at the unsubsidized price until December 12th. She tried to find a way around it, and we spent a while on the phone, somewhat unsuccessfully. The result was that I went to the Apple Store in Holyoke today to try to badger them into giving me a phone for the cheap price. They couldn’t for any of the reasons we had thought of, but it turned out my father’s line (on the family plan) was eligible for an upgrade, so we bought the phone through that line, and then went to the AT&amp;T store and had them switch it. This took two full trips back and forth, but it got done, and the result is that I have the new iPhone, which is awesome. I’m still working on a case for it, but the new features seem to be pretty great." />

<p>This evening I was in Natick seeing <a href="http://cadence-unplugged.com" target="_blank">Cadence</a> with two other members of 5-Alone. The show was excellent. They did a lot more jazz standard and barbershop type stuff than I was expecting. It was all good, but some of it felt a little recursive after a while. Except for the Cole Porter. Cole Porter is really the best. You just can’t beat him in terms of standards. Fabulous.</p>

<p>It has been an extremely successful day.</p>
