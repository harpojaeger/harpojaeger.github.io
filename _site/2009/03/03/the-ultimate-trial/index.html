  <article class="post-content">
  <p>I am pretty tired from practice today.  We are postponing tryouts until all of this DAMN SNOW has melted and we can actually get to the field.  Until then, we are running outside, and doing workouts inside.  Speaking of workouts, I came up with the most AWESOME workout today.  To begin, I must explain my school’s building.  There are three floors, and there are three staircases, one at each end, and one about 2/5 of the way down the hall.  The workout is that you run up and down a single staircase about ten times to warm up, and then, when you reach the bottom, you open the door, and sprint down the hall to the next stairway.  You run up and down that one, and then sprint to the next one.  Then you run up and down that one, and work your way back and forth again.  It is great because it combines light jogging (down stairs), heavy jogging (up stairs), and sprinting, which are all important in ultimate.  Better still, it gets you used to changing which one you are doing and then going back to another; endurance and explosiveness.  It is FABULOUSLY tiring.  After, we joined up with the people who had been running outside, and had an excellent workout inside.</p>

<p>We have a trial tomorrow afternoon; a tiebreaker in our region.  We are playing Tantasqua.  We have never faced this school before, so we don’t know what to expect.  Also, since we are up to the tiebreaker level now, this trial and all after it are coin flips.  That is, we arrive, and the two teams flip a coin.  The winner of the coin flip determines which side their team will present.  We know which side we will call if we win, but we have to be ready to do either one.  Thus, I will run my closing through a couple times tonight, and then get a lot of sleep.</p>

<p>Having trials on Wednesdays is great for me because it means I have no classes.  Thus, I do not need to do any homework.</p>

<p>I am solidifying plans for Watchmen.  We have an extra ticket because one friend backed out on us, so I will try to sell it to someone beforehand, or at the show, which I imagine will be pretty easy.  The question I am dealing with now relates to the fact that I have discovered that another group of my friends is going to the theater right after school to get on line.  I would go with them, but it is my sister’s birthday, so I will need to be at home.  I am therefore debating the morality of having them save us spots on line.  It would only be four people, so it is not as if we will be doing a huge disservice to the people behind them, but it could result in some pretty serious anger from the rest of the people on line.  I have to consult with my friends tomorrow before making a decision.</p>
