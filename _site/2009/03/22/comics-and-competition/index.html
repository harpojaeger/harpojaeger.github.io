  <p>The <a href="http://webcomicsweekend.com" target="_blank">Webcomics Weekend</a> was a huge success, at least for the two hours I was there. I met a lot of awesome people, including <a href="http://qwantz.com/" target="_blank">Ryan North</a>, <a href="http://wondermark.com/" target="_blank">David Malki</a>, <a href="http://asofterworld.com" target="_blank">Joey Comeau, and Emily Horne</a>. I bought <a href="http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=TO&amp;Product_Code=WON-REVOLUTION&amp;Category_Code=WON" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=TO&amp;Product_Code=QW-PANELTWO&amp;Category_Code=QW" target="_blank">shirts</a>, the first for me and the second for a friend who couldn’t come but is a die hard Dinosaur Comics fan. Also I got a gigantic pastrami sandwich on an onion bagel at the restaurant at Eastworks, which lasted me the rest of the day.</p>

<p>We didn’t do so well at <a href="http://www.harmony-sweepstakes.com/boston.html" target="_blank">Harmony Sweeps</a>. We didn’t place or get Audience Favorite (we did both last year), but the groups that did were fabulous. I didn’t feel that disappointed, because I had a really great time, heard some really good music, and got a chance to perform with some really fun people.</p>

<p>Also, I had a singularly AWESOME experience after the show. A bunch of girls came up to the group, and asked for our AUTOGRAPHS! And they wanted pictures with us! It was SO COOL! I have NEVER given an autograph before, and I enjoyed it so much. They said that they were part of a high school choir as well, and they wanted us to come see their show, which we totally would have, except that it is on June 1st, which is <a href="http://5alone.com" target="_blank">5-Alone</a>‘s big show as well, and my birthday with all of its investment and skydiving-related opportunities and commitments. Speaking of my birthday, I was recently informed that <a href="http://www.luckystattoo.org/" target="_blank">Lucky’s</a>, a tattoo and piercing parlor in Northampton, will give you a free piercing on your eighteenth birthday. This fits in perfectly with my planned theme for that whole day, so I am considering getting another piercing. It would definitely be an ear. I have to decide if I want to get my other (right) earlobe pierced, or if I want to go for one of those upper-ear-type things, and if so, if I want it to be on the left (already pierced) ear, or or the right. Decision, decisions.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I am sleeping, going to see my school’s production of Hair with a friend, and going to a Mock Trial meeting.</p>
