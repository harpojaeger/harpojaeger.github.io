  <p>Now we have a week long vacation. This seems like rather poor planning to me; we have had one week of second semester. It was a good week, but it is weird to come back and then leave again immediately.</p>

<p>That aside, I think this is going to be a fabulous semester. I have awesome classes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rise and Fall of the Great Powers</li>
  <li>Playwriting</li>
  <li>Chemistry</li>
  <li>Statistics</li>
  <li>Mock Trial</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides these, I have three independent studies in Spanish, multi-variable Calculus, and Physics E&amp;M (electricity and magnetism). I have not done much work on these for the past few months, so I will be doing a lot of catch-up this vacation. My hope is to burn through the Calc assignment I’ve had sitting around for about three months, get a few more from my teacher by email, and finish all of the Physics work I should have had done by the end of first semester. The Physics study is a bit harder than Calc. First of all, <a href="http://willszal.com" target="_blank">Will</a>and I are preparing to take both of the AP Physics C tests in May, so we have an actual rubric to measure ourselves against. Secondly, my advisor gives me assignments for Calc, but my advisor for Physics was too busy to do this. So while he’s still my advisor on paper, and is very helpful when I have questions about the material, Will and I are making up our own assignments as we go. We’ve created some shared Google Documents to keep track of our work on these two independent studies, but have really fallen behind since then. No more.</p>

<p>It is good to reach the end of the week. I will be working both days this weekend, three days next week, and potentially next weekend as well. Also, the Mock Trial team is meeting four times over vacation. One of them is to go bowling.</p>
