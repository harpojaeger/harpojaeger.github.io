  <p>The glassware at my house is almost as diverse as the <a href="http://harpojaeger.github.io/2009/02/02/silverware/">silverware</a> in origin and purpose.  Interestingly, as the capacity increases, they tend to become less and less impact-resistant.  Because of the rather high frequency with which we break glasses, we have about six or seven different sets.  One of the inherent challenges this poses is storage compatibility; certain sets can be stacked in certain ways, some can be cross-stacked, but some cannot.  For instance, there are a few sets that are completely incompatible with each other; if stacked they will break or become completely stuck, necessitating the use of hot and cold water as an agent of thermal expansion and contraction.</p>

<p>Another complication is that some of the glasses fit in the dishwasher in certain ways and others do not.  For example, the top rack of the dishwasher has on the left side a sort of plastic ledge that folds down.  If you stack only mugs or small glasses under it, you can fold it down and stack another layer of short items on top, provided they aren&#8217;t tall enough to hit the top of the dishwasher.</p>

<p>The smallest set of glasses currently operation has perhaps two surviving members.  We have been using this one for almost a decade.  Only a few are left, but they are incredibly strong.  This is why it&#8217;s lasted so long.  We have a concrete countertop, and I have dropped these glasses onto it from a distance of close to five feet, and they have been fine.  They are practically indestructible.  They are also very well designed in that they are constructed of safety glass, so when they break, they don&#8217;t break into many long sharp fragments, they break into many small and rounded ones.  They are a pain to clean up, because they go everywhere, but you can sweep them up with your hands, and we don&#8217;t have to worry about missing them and having to watch out for them for weeks to come.  Excellent industrial design.  All glass-manufacturers should do the same.</p>

<p>I wonder if there is some sort of coalition or alliance of international glassware-makers.</p>
