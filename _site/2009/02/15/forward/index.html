  <p>This has been an exhausting weekend, and it is not over yet. Yesterday I was at work all day, and was fortunate enough to have someone bring in a computer that had been dropped repeatedly, and, I kid you not, had port spilled over the keyboard. Last night we cooked a sumptuous Valentine’s Day meal, which included steak, sweet potatoes, and other such awesome things.

<p>I discovered a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7888539.stm" target="_blank">fabulous article on the BBC. </a>My first name is Rafael.</p>

<p>Today I went to Costco in the morning to pick up my new glasses, which are very subtle. Then I worked from 12-4. Now I am home. My family is on their way back from a show at my school (M. Butterfly [which I was REALLY bummed to miss (they sold out of tickets to last night’s show [we got tickets to the matinee today (which I couldn’t go to [because I was at work (but last night my friend told me that there were in fact seats available at last night’s show [so I could have gone (which makes me pretty angry)])])])]), and we are going to go to dinner at our friends’ house in Conway. I have not seen this family for a long time, so I am looking forward to it immensely.</p>

<p>As I got my requisite slice of pizza for lunch it occurred to me that I have been eating junk food all day. I had pie when I woke up, a hot dog at Costco, and then pizza for lunch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3jv2cUgt1M" target="_blank">Pizzazz (Gonna Give It To Ya!<span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span></a>is a video made by two of my coworkers when they were in college. It is one of the funniest things I have seen in a long time.</p>

<p>We are having a Mock Trial meeting at my house tomorrow. I will be <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93170569" target="_blank">bedinnering</a> the team. Pesto.</p>

<p>Over and out.</p>
