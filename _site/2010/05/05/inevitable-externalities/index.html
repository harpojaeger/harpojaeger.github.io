  <p>You can’t plan for everything. We know that BP <a href="http://climateprogress.org/2010/05/02/is-bp-the-goldman-sachs-of-big-oil-ceo-hayward-says-to-fellow-executives-what-the-hell-did-we-do-to-deserve-this/" target="_blank">avoided</a> paying $500,000 for a piece of safety equipment that’s mandatory in other countries, a remote shutoff valve that might have been able to prevent the worst of what we’re seeing now. Clearly this is a pretty loud cry for better regulations. And while I certainly don’t think this is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/30/the-obamas-katrina-meme-m_n_559203.html" target="_blank">Obama’s fault</a>, I’m <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0510/36783.html#ixzz0n3fp5acz" target="_blank">also reluctant to blame the Bush administration</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BP and its employees have given more than $3.5 million to federal candidates over the past 20 years, with the largest chunk of their money going to Obama, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not saying this to advance some sort of crazy conspiracy that Obama conspired to blow up the rig to improve the chances of banning offshore drilling and getting a comprehensive energy-climate bill through (because somehow in this country’s political discourse, 11 dead workers andmassive <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/gulf-oil-spill/index.ssf/2010/05/gulf_oil_spill_taints_mediterr.html" target="_blank">environmental</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/03/AR2010050301669.html?hpid=topnews" target="_blank">economic</a> damage is a <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2010/05/04/boehner-real-comprehensive-drilling/" target="_blank">reason to drill <em>more</em>, not less</a>, and it looks like <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704866204575224582701608508.html" target="_blank">this is going to make Kerry-Graham-Lieberman <em>harder</em>, not easier</a>), or that the response was deliberately slow (<a href="http://assets/mediamatters.org/research/201004300053" target="_blank">it wasn’t</a> [and if you only read one of the links from this piece, it should be that one]), just that a culture of deregulation has been normal for a long time. Notwithstanding <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/business/30comply.html?ref=politics" target="_blank">smaller regulatory moves</a> like this (which in my opinion are what differentiate this administration from the last), I don’t think that it’s fair to blame the laxity of American corporate (especially energy) regulations entirely on Bush.</p>

<p>What we have a chance to do now is to reclaim the externalities. It’s time to impose a windfall profits tax on all non-renewable energy companies, and mark all revenues collected for clean energy R&amp;D and investment. That’s going to be hard with people like Mary Landrieu and John Boehner holding as much sway as they do because of <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/234517" target="_blank">bizarre and misused parliamentary procedures</a>, but it needs to be done. A price on carbon would be <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-vine/the-gulf-spill-and-the-climate-bill-cont" target="_blank">nice</a> too. We need <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/2010-04-30-wake-up-obama.-the-gulf-spill-is-our-big-chance" target="_blank">strong leadership</a> from Obama right now. His history with offshore drilling <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/31/barack-obama/once-wobbly-obama-not-inconsistent-latest-oil-dril/" target="_blank">is complicated</a>, but I really do believe he wants it ended. It’s a question of political feasibility. And this is his chance.</p>

<p>If we let the GOP (read: the ones calling for expanded offshore drilling) get away with painting themselves as the true bearers of a “comprehensive” (and <a href="http://www.gop.gov/energy" target="_blank">their plan</a> is <a href="http://climateprogress.org/2010/02/03/energy-only-bill-lindsey-graham-half-assed/" target="_blank">anything but</a>), it won’t just be a political defeat. Cap-and-trade (which I continue to defend as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/magazine/11Economy-t.html" target="_blank">the best system out there</a>) will be dead, and if the GOP gains a majority in the House this year (which is looking increasingly likely), we may not get a comprehensive energy-climate bill until it’s <a href="http://climateprogress.org/2009/06/15/us-global-change-research-program-noaa-global-climate-change-impacts-in-united-states/" target="_blank">too late</a>.</p>
