I’ll be writing full reviews of both works when I finish them, and eventually (after some more reading and research) comparing them using a variety of methods. For the moment, however, I’ve decided to take notes on my reading as I go in order to make the review process easier. The notes are in a Google Doc, and I’ve made it publicly accessible, so you can follow along with my thoughts as I go. The document can be foundhere. I expect to learn a ton from this reading, so I think the notes will be really interesting." />

  <p>I’ve just started reading <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em>, Milton Friedman’s seminal work which is in many ways the basis of modern free-market economics (Keynes’ <em>The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</em> is next). I’ll be writing full reviews of both works when I finish them, and eventually (after some more reading and research) comparing them using a variety of methods. For the moment, however, I’ve decided to take notes on my reading as I go in order to make the review process easier. The notes are in a Google Doc, and I’ve made it publicly accessible, so you can follow along with my thoughts as I go. The document can be found<a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dgsccg68_18f2nmjfc3" target="_blank">here</a>. I expect to learn a ton from this reading, so I think the notes will be really interesting.</p>

<p>I’d love to get feedback, so please feel free to get in touch with me however you like: in the comments, on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/renaissanceboy" target="_blank">@renaissanceboy</a>), or whatever.</p>
