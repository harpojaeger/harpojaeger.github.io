  <p>I heard Alice’s Restaurant on the radio in the car today. I was on the way to Stop &amp; Shop, which turned out to be closed, as was Bigy Y and Wal-Mart. Our pies are going to have to go crustless.<br />
We are on our way to our friends’ house in Ashfield for Thanksgiving.<br />
Over the past 24 hours, I have gained a lot of respect for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a>. As the <a href="http://www.google.com/news?ncl=1274759292&amp;hl=en&amp;topic=h" target="_blank">crisis</a> in India has unfolded, they have been posting updates, and, more importantly, calls for information. To be sure, this is not a new or original practice in news agencies; the <a href="http://bbc.com" target="_blank">BBC</a> (another news organization I regard highly) does it quite often as well, but this is at a higher level than I’ve seen before. At the heart of this practice is an admission that one person or entity can’t know everything. The New York Times has been asking for eyewitness reports, stories, reactions, as well as just basic information. This particular incident has been singular in terms of its unknown origins; the “group” that has claimed responsibility is reminiscent of Quantum from the new James Bond movie, ironically enough, in that no one has ever heard of it. Whether it was created as a front for just this particular instance or it has really been operating under the radar for some time, it’s disturbing. I know I speak for others as well as myself when I say that our thoughts are with those who’ve been affected by this tragedy, as well as those who felt so desperate that this was all they could do.<br />
I’ve been thinking a lot about this kind if thing recently. I have a bunch of close friends in Israel and Palestine at the moment, and it has been interesting hearing about their experiences. I also had an intriguing conversation with a gentleman who came into the shop a few days ago. He works in that same area as a peace organizer and mediator. Although we didn’t talk for long, I felt as though I learned a lot just from the way he conducted himself and spoke about the issues. One thing I really appreciated was that he was thoughtful enough to be able to put ideology and beliefs aside and agree that everyone involved in the conflict was acting in a deplorable manner.<br />
Today is a good day to consider what we have and are thankful for as well as what we wish for others. May everyone be as lucky as I and those I know to have family friends who love us, security, and dignity.</p>
