  <p>I have maintained total radio silence for the past four days or so due to a variety of reasons. Some involve Brown, some do not. I will begin with those that do. The long and short of it (as I don’t really have more information at the moment) is that I have been admitted to Brown University. As I applied using the binding Early Decision program, and I have received a legitimate amount of financial aid, I will be matriculating there this fall. I am incredibly relieved to be done with this process, and very excited to start school.<br />
This rather momentous news is, believe it or not, not the main reason for my preoccupation these last few days. I’ve been simultaneously performing in and running sound for our school’s annual Holiday Show, a music showcase which is usually thrown together at the last minute. This year was no exception, and as Mitch (the director of the music department, who is responsible for this show) was out of school a lot for the past month or so, due to a death in the family, the show was even more last-minute than usual. We really pulled it together, and there was even a group that dedicated a song to Mitch, and another teacher, Rahul, whose mother had passed away. They played Eric Clapton’s “Tears in Heaven”, which was wonderful. It was a fabulous show all around, and I had my hands full between performing with <a href="http://5alone.com" target="_blank">5-Alone</a> and doing a Matisyahu song with some friends (King Without a Crown). Last night I didn’t get home until about eleven because I was striking.<br />
I think I may take today off of work, as I am starting to cough again, and I have a whole lot of homework to do. Now that college is out of the way, I will be focusing solely on academics; more specifically, regaining the ground I lost during this time-consuming process. I have been a rather bad student for the past few months. No more.</p>
