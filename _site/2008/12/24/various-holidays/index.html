At my house we ate a lot of food, and played Charity Dreidel Smackdown, a game we invented last year where you play a normal game of Dreidel (which is entirely luck-based) and whoever wins gets to choose which charity all of the money gets donated to. My youngest sister won and chose Heifer International, so we are donating all of the money (and matching it ourselves)." />

  <p>I just got back from a friend’s Christmas party, which was excellent. Today was our last day of school; we are off until January 5th. I had a bunch of people over at my house for the third night of Hannukah, and we were here until about ten, so I only was at the last hour or so of my friend’s party, but it was a fabulous evening overall. At my house we ate a lot of food, and played Charity Dreidel Smackdown, a game we invented last year where you play a normal game of Dreidel (which is entirely luck-based) and whoever wins gets to choose which charity all of the money gets donated to. My youngest sister won and chose Heifer International, so we are donating all of the money (and matching it ourselves).</p>

<p>Apparently I missed sledding at my friend’s house, since the party started at seven and I got there at ten-thirty, but I did get there for the present swap (I brought brownies, and received a rubber fish for putting over a trailer hitch), and I saw A Charlie Brown Christmas for the first time. I feel like much more of a man now. Also, I surprised everyone by knowing all of the words to the Christmas carols they sang. Christmas carols are awesome. For many years, I have gone caroling with some close friends, and I hope to again this year. It is a ton of fun.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will be sleeping extremely late, and getting a leg up on a rather daunting homework load. My old Calculus BC class might have a reunion this weekend and go out for Chinese food, which would be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>I am glad to have a vacation.</p>
