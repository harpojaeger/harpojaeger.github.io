  <p>I would have written sooner, but yesterday was so exciting that I couldn&#8217;t. Therefore, I will present a chronological narrative of what has transpired since I left Penn Station yesterday.<br>
I arrived at the apartment easily, with a minimum of confusion on the subway. We hung around for a while, and eventually left to play Frisbee in Central Park. While playing, I noticed some people practicing a martial art, which I thought to be Aikido. Upon asking them, I learned that it was in fact the Butterfly form of Chinese Kung-Fu. We talked about martial arts for a while, and it somehow came up that I trained in Indonesian Kung-Fu. They asked me to do a demonstration, so I showed them two forms; a stationary form and the staff form. Then we left the park. We went to the 5:20 showing of The Dark Night. IN IMAX! I had already seen it twice, and it did not disappoint the third time. Especially when seen at 72&#8242; x 53&#8242;. We picked up some pizza on the way home for dinner.<br>
This morning we woke up at about 10:30, and left the house at about 11:00, walking towards Columbia University. We got breakfast at Nussbaum &amp; Wu, which was the ultimate culture clash experience. There were Asian workers, salsa music blaring, and the best pastrami (the only pastrami) I&#8217;ve had in a while. We briefly walked through the Columbia campus on the main lawn, before dropping off my friend at the subway, as her bus left at 1:00. We walked back towards the apartment, and I stopped to get a cinnamon Danish (amazing) at the Hungarian Pastry Shop (recommended to me by my mother, and pointed out to me by the friend I was staying with). We sat at the Sip, a tiny cafe and bar that is open 10AM-4AM every day, and has table and counter tops made of pennies. I reserved my train ticket on my friend&#8217;s laptop, and walked down to Broadway to get cash (I used her credit card to make the reservation). I said goodbye to her when I got back, and walked off to Central Park, intending to meet the martial artists again, as I recalled them saying they&#8217;d be in the same place the next day at 1:00, but when I arrived, they were nowhere to be found. So now I am sitting under a tree, finishing my Danish, and waiting to leave for my train. I am taking the C train from 110th St. to 34th St., where I can get to the Amtrak station underground. My train leaves at 4:30, so I will leave here at about 3:30, to leave time for an approximately half-hour long train ride, retrieving my ticket once I arrive, and boarding the train. This gives me another hour-and-three-quarters, in which I will probably just relax, and observe.<br>
At the moment, there is a children&#8217;s storyteller with a PA and a banjo telling a story to a group of children and parents. I think the story concerns many animals in a pit, hiding from what they believe to be the end of the world.<br>
There is a lot to see here, so I&#8217;m looking forward to having such a large block of time to see it.</p>
