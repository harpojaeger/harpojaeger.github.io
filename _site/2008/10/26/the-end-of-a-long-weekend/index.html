<title>The end of a long weekend - Harpo Jaeger</title>
<meta property="og:title" content="The end of a long weekend" />
<meta name="description" content="I had an excellent day at Olin, although very tiring. There were several interesting and informative presentations, and I also spent some time listening to a presentation / Q&amp;A session with a Computer Science professor, who talked about some very interesting topics and demonstrated some fascinating programs. One of them generated random text by taking an input (he demonstrated it with the text of The Great Gatsby). The program then generated a list of all the words that appear in the text, and a corresponding list of all of the words that follow each of those words, respectively, in the original text. Then it chooses a random word, chooses a random word from the list of words that follow it, chooses a random word from the list of words that follow that one, etc., building a randomized string of text. The result is a nonsensical and non-grammatical string of random words that still sounds exactly like the book. It is awesome. I have decided I am going to write the program in PHP and post it on this site somewhere. I am also thinking that it might be very interesting to run the program on the content of the Exquisite Corpse poems. This weekend marks the end of my college application process, or at least the brunt of it. I will be submitting my Brown application on Wednesday evening, and will then be done until I hear back from them, at which point I’ll either be completely finished, or will apply elsewhere if I don’t get in. I am indescribably glad to have this stuff finished." />
