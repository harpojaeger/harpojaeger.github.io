<meta name="description" content="I am on my way to Brown University for the day. We are currently on I-90 E, and so far I’ve noticed several things. First, the leaves are beautiful. There are all sorts of shades of pink and purple that you would never expect to see in nature. Secondly, we just passed a huge black armored vehicle of a type that we had never seen before. It had all sorts of antennas and lights on it, bearing some kind of small logo we couldn’t read in the lower right-hand corner of the back. Upon passing it, we noted the name “BEAR” on the front. A Google search for “bear armored vehicle” reveals that it is produced by Lenco Armored Vehicles, and is used as an ambulance or deployment unit in areas under fire. I tried to find more information on price, size, etc., but most of the site is restricted to military and law enforcement officials who have been provided with a username and password. In other, somewhat less covert news, I’ll be going to the typical tour/info session at Brown, as well as the engineering open house in the afternoon." />
