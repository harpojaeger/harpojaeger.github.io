<meta name="description" content="OK, stop everything. In the car on the way home today, I discovered the name of a town/region in Massachusetts that triumphs all others. Ever. Even ones I don’t know about yet. There is a place somewhat east of Wilbraham called Dingley Dell. This is not only a ridiculous name, but it is in a Monty Python sketch. I am going to go there sometime soon. I am not sure what I will do when I get there, but whatever it is will be AWESOME. I am also thinking of trying to get a mailing address or P.O. box there, just so I can have people send me things addressed to Dingley Dell, and I can put it on my return address. This is one of the most exciting moments of my life. The Exquisite Corpse page has gone live, found in the projects section. So far it has had a lot of success with the help of a bunch of my friends and family who have started a whole lot of poems. I am hoping that it continues to flourish and becomes self-sufficient. It is my plan not to contribute to it at all; I am interested in the idea of my creating something that is not ultimately owned by me. Although I’ve enabled it, I want it to be more of a medium for others than a demonstration of my skills." />
