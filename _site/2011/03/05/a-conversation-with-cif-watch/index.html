<meta name="description" content="When the J Street smear video broke (see my last post), CiF Watch tweeted a link to it, saying I was pro-BDS (I’m not). I replied, and over the next hour or so, we had a conversation about anti-semitism and anti-Zionism. I committed to writing a post exploring what I believe to be substantive differences between the two. I think an understanding of those differences is key for Zionists (or anyone who’s not an anti-Zionist) crying wolf at false cases of anti-semitism is not only incredibly damaging to those accused, which in and of itself should be enough of a reason not to do it, but ultimately counterproductive in actually identifying real cases of anti-semitism." />

  <p>When the J Street smear video broke (see <a title="Fisking yet another smear against J Street" href="http://www.harpojaeger.com/2011/03/04/fisking-yet-another-smear-against-j-street/" target="_blank">my last post</a>), <a href="http://cifwatch.com/" target="_blank">CiF Watch</a> tweeted a link to it, saying I was pro-BDS (<a title="BDS: a threat to peace" href="http://www.harpojaeger.com/2009/11/21/bds-a-threat-to-peace/" target="_blank">I’m not</a>). I replied, and over the next hour or so, we had a conversation about anti-semitism and anti-Zionism. I committed to writing a post exploring what I believe to be substantive differences between the two. I think an understanding of those differences is key for Zionists (or anyone who’s not an anti-Zionist)  crying wolf at false cases of anti-semitism is not only incredibly damaging to those accused, which in and of itself should be enough of a reason not to do it, but ultimately counterproductive in actually identifying real cases of anti-semitism.</p>

<p>I’m planning to write that post tomorrow or early next week, but here’s the conversation that<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/cifwatch" target="_blank"> @CiFWatch</a> and I had on Twitter. CiF Watch deleted their initial tweet claiming I was pro-BDS after I corrected them, so you won’t see that one here. Also note that the conversation goes on beyond the excerpt here  hit the “view more” button at the bottom to see the whole thing.</p>
