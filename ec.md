<h3>what is this?</h3>
<p>This is an electronic version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse" target="_blank">Surrealist parlor game Exquisite Corpse</a>, in which players write a communal poem by each contributing one line, having seen only the one that comes directly before.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://jonrendell.com/" target="_blank">Jon Rendell</a> has some <a href="http://jonrendell.com/definition/About.html" target="_blank">more interesting information about the origins of the game</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, <a href="http://www.artandculture.com/users/2570-danielle-ezzo#Blog" target="_blank">Danielle Ezzo</a> runs Exquisite Corpse-themed dinners in NYC.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these days I'm planning to go to one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I'll see you there?</p>
<h3>how do i use it?</h3>
<p>See the <strong>bold</strong> text?&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the most recent line of one of the currently in-progress poems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Write whatever you think should come next in the first box (be creative!) and click "add."&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think your line should be the last, click "end" instead (or leave the box blank to make the displayed line the last).&nbsp;&nbsp;The second box lets you start a brand new poem.</p>
<h3>completed poems (most recent at the top)</h3><p>jump to poem #<span id="poem_navigation"></span>
