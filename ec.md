### Down for maintenance

After many, many years in pretty much the same state, I'm totally rewriting the online Exquisite Corpse project using Node and React.  The new version should be done in early May.  Until then, you can read the finished poems below.  All existing finished and in-progress poems will be migrated over to the new system.

### What is this?

Anonymous poetry, written one line at a time.  No one sees the whole poem until it's [done](#completed).

Exquisite Corpse began as a [Surrealist parlor game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse) in the early 20th century.  I created this Internet version in 2009.  Read the [fine print](#fineprint).
